renewable energy in the republic of ireland wikipedia renewable energy in the republic of ireland from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search under the renewable energy directive ireland has set a target of producing 16 of all its energy needs from renewable energy sources by 2020 between 2005 and 2014 the percentage of energy from renewable energy sources grew from just 3.1 to 8.6 of total final consumption by 2020 ireland has a target of producing 42.5 of its electricity needs from renewable electricity the country has a large and growing installed windpower capacity at 2,486 mw by the end of 2015 producing just under a quarter of all its electricity needs in that year in contrast in 2015 it had the second lowest installation of solar pv power in the eu after latvia

according to the irish national renewable energy action plan nreap 1 as submitted by all member states as part of the eu renewable energy directive in 2020 the gross final energy consumption in

sector also known as the thermal sector includes domestic heating and air conditioning and industrial heat processes is expected to account for 36.6 of final energy consumption the electricity sector is projected to account for 20.9 of consumption total annual energy consumption after adjustments is projected to be 14,142 ktoe 14.142 million tonnes of oil equivalent by 2020 to meet ireland’s overall target of16 use of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption by 2020 it was just 3.1 in 2005 targets have been set for each sector by 2020 renewable energy use is targeted to be 12 in

ireland’s third progress report by 2014 the country had achieved an 8.6 share of overall energy use from renewable energy sources this was beow the targeted 11 share planned for that year renewable energy use in the electricity sector was the furthest from its target of just over 8 percentage points below its target for the year renewable energy use in the electricity sector has been shown to rise quickly in other years and in other countries so ireland may move closer to achieving its 2020 targets in the next few years
