the distance food is transported from the time of its production until it reaches the consumer food miles are one factor used when assessing the environmental impact of food including the impact on global warming 1 the concept of food miles originated in the early 1990s in the united kingdom it was conceived by professor tim lang 2 at the sustainable agriculture food and environment safe alliance 3 and first appeared in print in a report “the food miles report the dangers of long-distance food transport” researched and written by angela paxton 4 5 some scholars believe that an increase in the organic resource food travels is due to the globalization of trade the focus of food supply bases into fewer larger districts drastic changes in delivery patterns the increase in processed and packaged foods and making fewer trips to the supermarket at the same time most of the greenhouse gas emissions created by food have their origin in the production phases which create 83 of overall emissions of co 2 6 a range of studies compare emissions over the entire food cycle including production consumption and transport 7 these include estimates of food-related emissions of greenhouse gas up to the farm gate versus beyond the farm gate in the uk for example agricultural-related emissions may account for approximately 40 of the overall food chain including retail packaging fertilizer manufacture and other factors whereas greenhouse gases emitted in transport account for around 12 of overall food-chain emissions 8 the goal of environmental protection agencies is to make people aware of the environmental impact of food miles and to show the pollution percentage and the energy used to transport food over long distances citation needed researchers are currently working to provide the public with more information the concept of food miles has been criticised and food miles are not always correlated with the actual environmental impact of food production overview edit the concept of food miles is part of the broader issue of sustainability which deals with a large range of environmental social and economic issues including local food the term was coined by tim lang now professor of food policy city university london who says the point was to highlight the hidden ecological social and economic consequences of food production to consumers in a simple way one which had objective reality but also connotations 9 food that is transported by road produces more carbon emissions than any other form of transported food road transport produces 60 of the world s food transport carbon emissions air transport produces 20 of the world s food transport carbon emissions rail and sea transport produce 10 each of the world s food transport carbon emissions although it was never intended as a complete measure of environmental impact it has come under attack as an ineffective means of finding the true environmental impact for example a defra report in 2005 undertaken by researchers at aea technology environment entitled the validity of food miles as an indicator of sustainable development included findings that the direct environmental social and economic costs of food transport are over £9 billion each year and are dominated by congestion 10 the report also indicates that it is not only how far the food has travelled but the method of travel in all parts of the food chain that is important to consider many trips by personal cars to shopping centres would have a negative environmental impact compared to transporting a few truckloads to neighbourhood stores that can be easily reached by walking or cycling more emissions are created by the drive to the supermarket to buy air freighted food than was created by the air freighting in the first place 11 also the positive environmental effects of organic farming may be compromised by increased transportation unless it is produced by local farms the carbon trust notes that to understand the carbon emissions from food production all the carbon-emitting processes that occur as a result of getting food from the field to our plates need to be considered including production origin seasonality and home care 12 food miles in business edit a recent study led by professor miguel gomez applied economics and management at cornell university and supported by the atkinson center for a sustainable future found that in many instances the supermarket supply chain did much better in terms of food miles and fuel consumption for each pound compared to farmers markets it suggests that selling local foods through supermarkets may be more economically viable and sustainable than through farmers markets 13 calculating food miles edit with processed foods that are made of many different ingredients it is very complicated though not impossible to calculate the co2 emissions from transport by multiplying the distance travelled of each ingredient by the carbon intensity of the mode of transport air road or rail however as both prof lang and the original food miles report noted the resulting number – although interesting cannot give the whole picture of how sustainable – or not – a food product is 4 criticism edit fair trade edit according to oxfam researchers there are many other aspects of the agricultural processing and the food supply chain that also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions which are not taken into account by simple food miles measurements 14 15 there are benefits to be gained by improving livelihoods in poor countries through agricultural development smallholder farmers in poor countries can often improve their income and standard of living if they can sell to distant export markets for higher value horticultural produce moving away from the subsistence agriculture of producing staple crops for their own consumption or local markets 16 however exports from poor countries do not always benefit poor people unless the product has a fairtrade label or a label from another robust and independent scheme food exports might make a bad situation worse citation needed for example wages are often very low and working conditions bad and sometimes dangerous sometimes the food grown for export takes up land that had been used to grow food for local consumption so local people can go hungry 17 energy used in production as well as transport edit researchers say a more complete environmental assessment of food that consumers buy needs to take into account how the food has been produced and what energy is used in its production a recent defra case study indicated that tomatoes grown in spain and transported to the united kingdom may have a lower carbon footprint in terms of energy efficiency than tomatoes grown in heated greenhouses in the united kingdom 18 according to german researchers the food miles concept misleads consumers because the size of transportation and production units is not taken into account using the methodology of life cycle assessment lca in accordance to iso 14040 entire supply chains to provide german consumers with food were investigated comparing local food with food of european and global provenance as a matter of fact an increasing size of transportation and production units leads to decreasing energy use per kilogram food research reports from the chair of process engineering in food and service business prof dr.-ing elmar h schlich at justus liebig university giessen germany define and establish the term and theory of ecologies of scale by analogy to the well-known term of economies of scale in terms of energy use per kilogram small food production units may cause even more environmental impact compared to bigger units even if the food miles are lower case studies of lamb meat beef bottled wine apples fruit juices and pork meat gave evidence to this and disproved the food miles concept as too simple 19 20 21 a 2006 research report from the agribusiness and economics research unit at lincoln university new zealand counters claims about food miles by comparing total energy used in food production in europe and new zealand taking into account energy used to ship the food to europe for consumers 22 23 the report states new zealand has greater production efficiency in many food commodities compared to the uk for example new zealand agriculture tends to apply fewer fertilizers which require large amounts of energy to produce and cause significant co2 emissions and animals are able to graze year round outside eating grass instead of large quantities of brought-in feed such as concentrates in the case of dairy and sheep meat production nz is by far more energy efficient even including the transport cost than the uk twice as efficient in the case of dairy and four times as efficient in case of sheep meat 11 in the case of apples nz is more energy-efficient even though the energy embodied in capital items and other inputs data was not available for the uk other researchers have contested the claims from new zealand professor gareth edwards-jones has said that the arguments “in favour of new zealand apples shipped to the uk is probably true only or about two months a year during july and august when the carbon footprint for locally grown fruit doubles because it comes out of cool stores.” 24 studies by dr christopher weber et al of the total carbon footprint of food production in the u.s have shown transportation to be of minor importance compared to the carbon emissions resulting from pesticide and fertilizer production and the fuel required by farm and food processing equipment 25 intensive livestock production as a source of greenhouse gases edit farm animals account for between 20 and 30 of global greenhouse gas emissions 26 27 that figure includes the clearing of land to feed and graze the animals clearing land of trees and cultivation are the main drivers of farming emissions deforestation eliminates carbon sinks accelerating the process of climate change cultivation including the use of synthetic fertilisers releases greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide nitrogen fertiliser is especially demanding of fossil fuels as producing a tonne of it takes 1.5 tonnes of oil 14 meanwhile it’s increasingly recognised that meat and dairy are the largest sources of food-related emissions the uk’s consumption of meat and dairy products including imports accounts for about 8 of national greenhouse gas emissions related to consumption 14 according to a study by engineers christopher weber and h scott matthews of carnegie mellon university of all the greenhouse gases emitted by the food industry only 4 comes from transporting the food from producers to retailers the study also concluded that adopting a vegetarian diet even if the vegetarian food is transported over very long distances does far more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions than does eating a locally grown diet 28 they also concluded that shifting less than one day per week’s worth of calories from red meat and dairy products to chicken fish eggs or a vegetable-based diet achieves more ghg reduction than buying all locally sourced food in other words the amount of red meat consumption is much more important than food miles local food miles edit a commonly ignored element is the local loop for example a gallon of gasoline could transport 5 kg of meat over 60,000 miles 97,000 km by road 40 tonner at 8 mpg in bulk transport or it could transport a single consumer only 30 or 40 miles 64 km to buy that meat thus foods from a distant farm that are transported in bulk to a nearby store consumer can have a lower footprint than foods a consumer picks up directly from a farm that is within driving distance but farther away than the store this can mean that doorstep deliveries of food by companies can lead to lower carbon emissions or energy use than normal shopping practices 29 relative distances and mode of transportation make this calculation complicated for example consumers can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of their part of the journey by walking bicycling or taking public transport another impact is that goods being transported by large ships very long distances can have lower associated carbon emissions or energy use than the same goods traveling by truck a much shorter distance 30 lifecycle analysis rather than food miles edit lifecycle analysis a technique that meshes together a wide range of different environmental criteria including emissions and waste is a more holistic way of assessing the real environmental impact of the food we eat the technique accounts for energy input and output involved in the production processing packaging and transport of food it also factors in resource depletion air pollution and water pollution and waste generation municipal solid waste 31 a number of organisations are developing ways of calculating the carbon cost or lifecycle impact of food and agriculture 32 some are more robust than others but at the moment there is no easy way to tell which ones are thorough independent and reliable and which ones are just marketing hype other aspects of sustainability such as local jobs and health edit even a full lifecycle analysis accounts only for the environmental effects of food production and consumption important though that is it is only one of the widely agreed three pillars of sustainable development namely environmental social and economic 33
