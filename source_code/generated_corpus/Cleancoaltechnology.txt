clean coal technology wikipedia clean coal technology from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article is about technological innovations related to clean coal for clean coal as a general concept see clean coal clean coal technology is a collection of technologies being developed to mitigate the environmental impact of coal energy generation 1 when coal is used as a fuel source the gaseous emissions generated by the thermal decomposition of the coal include sulphur dioxide so 2 nitrogen oxides no x carbon dioxide co 2 mercury and other chemical byproducts that vary depending on the type of the coal being used these emissions have been established to have a negative impact on the environment and human health contributing to acid rain lung cancer and cardiovascular disease as a result clean coal technologies are being developed to remove or reduce pollutant emissions to the atmosphere some of the techniques that would be used to accomplish this include chemically washing minerals and impurities from the coal gasification see also igcc improved technology for treating flue gases to remove pollutants to increasingly stringent levels and at higher efficiency carbon capture and storage technologies to capture the carbon dioxide from the flue gas and dewatering lower rank coals brown coals to improve the calorific value and thus the efficiency of the conversion into electricity figures from the united states environmental protection agency show that these technologies have made today’s coal-based generating fleet 77 percent cleaner on the basis of regulated emissions per unit of energy produced 2 clean coal technology usually addresses atmospheric problems resulting from burning coal historically the primary focus was on so 2 and no x the most important gases in causation of acid rain and particulates which cause visible air pollution and deleterious effects on human health concerns exist regarding the economic viability of these technologies and the timeframe of delivery 3 potentially high hidden economic costs in terms of social and environmental damage 4 and the costs and viability of disposing of removed carbon and other toxic matter 5 6 technology edit several different technological methods are available for the purpose of carbon capture as demanded by the clean coal concept pre-combustion capture this involves gasification of a feedstock such as coal to form synthesis gas which may be shifted to produce a h 2 and co 2 rich gas mixture from which the co 2 can be efficiently captured and separated transported and ultimately sequestered 7 this technology is usually associated with integrated gasification combined cycle process configurations 8 post-combustion capture this refers to capture of co 2 from exhaust gases of combustion processes oxy-fuel combustion fossil fuels such as coal are burned in a mixture of recirculated flue gas and oxygen rather than in air which largely eliminates nitrogen from the flue gas enabling efficient low-cost co 2 capture 9 the kemper county igcc project a 582 mw coal gasification based power plant will use pre-combustion capture of co 2 to capture 65 of the co 2 the plant produces which will be utilized geologically sequestered in enhanced oil recovery operations 10 the saskatchewan government s boundary dam integrated carbon capture and sequestration demonstration project will use post-combustion amine-based scrubber technology to capture 90 of the co 2 emitted by unit 3 of the power plant this co 2 will be pipelined to and utilized for enhanced oil recovery in the weyburn oil fields 11 an oxyfuel ccs power plant operation processes the exhaust gases so as to separate the co 2 so that it may be stored or sequestered an early example of a coal-based plant using oxy-fuel carbon-capture technology is swedish company vattenfall ’s schwarze pumpe power station located in spremberg germany built by german firm siemens which went on-line in september 2008 12 13 the facility captures co 2 and acid rain producing pollutants separates them and compresses the co 2 into a liquid plans are to inject the co 2 into depleted natural gas fields or other geological formations vattenfall opines that this technology is considered not to be a final solution for co 2 reduction in the atmosphere but provides an achievable solution in the near term while more desirable alternative solutions to power generation can be made economically practical 13 other examples of oxy-combustion carbon capture are in progress callide power station has retrofitted a 30-mwth existing pc-fired power plant to operate in oxy-fuel mode in ciuden spain endesa has a newly built 30-mwth oxy-fuel plant using circulating fluidized bed combustion cfbc technology 14 babcock-thermoenergy s zero emission boiler system zebs is oxy-combustion-based this system features near 100 carbon-capture and according to company information virtually no air-emissions 15 other carbon capture and storage technologies include those that dewater low-rank coals low-rank coals often contain a higher level of moisture content which contains a lower energy content per tonne this causes a reduced burning efficiency and an increased emissions output reduction of moisture from the coal prior to combustion can reduce emissions by up to 50 percent citation needed the uk government s is working towards a clean energy future and supports clean coal projects across the country in august 2010 uk-based company b9 coal announced a clean coal project with 90 carbon capture to be put forward to decc this would help the uk raise its profile amongst green leaders across the world this proposed project gasifies coal underground and processes it to create pure streams of hydrogen and carbon dioxide the hydrogen is then used as an emissions-free fuel to run an alkaline fuel cell whilst the carbon dioxide is captured this uk project could provide a world-leading template for clean coal with ccs globally demonstration projects in the united states edit in the late 1980s and early 1990s the u.s department of energy doe began conducting a joint program with the industry and state agencies to demonstrate clean coal technologies large enough for commercial use the program called the clean coal technology clean coal power initiative ccpi has had a number of successes that have reduced emissions and waste from coal-based electricity generation 16 the national energy technology laboratory has administered three rounds of ccpi funding and the following projects were selected during each round 17 round 1 ccpi projects advanced multi-product coal utilization by-product processing plant demonstration of integrated optimization software at the baldwin energy complex gilberton coal-to-clean fuels and power co-production project increasing power plant efficiency lignite fuel enhancement toxecon retrofit for mercury and multi-pollutant control on three 90-mw coal-fired boilers western greenbrier co-production demonstration project commercial demonstration of the airborne process integration of advanced emission controls to produce next-generation circulating fluid bed coal generating unit round 2 ccpi projects airborne process tm commercial scale demonstration program demonstration of a coal-based transport gasifier mercury species and multi-pollutant control project mesaba energy project round 3 ccpi projects american electric power project antelope valley station post-combustion co 2 project hydrogen energy california project nrg energy project southern company carbon capture kemper project summit texas clean energy project these programs have helped to meet regulatory challenges by incorporating pollution control technologies into a portfolio of cost-effective regulatory compliance options for conventional and developmental coal-fired power plants this portfolio has positioned the u.s as a top exporter of clean coal technologies such as those used for sox nox and mercury and more recently for carbon capture consistent with a goal of deploying advanced coal-based power systems in commercial service with improved efficiency and environmental performance to meet increasingly stringent environmental regulations and market demands leading to widespread global deployment which will contribute to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions the doe continues its programs and initiatives through regional sequestration partnerships a carbon sequestration leadership forum and the carbon sequestration core program a ccs research and development program 18 according to a report by the assistant secretary for fossil energy at the u.s department of energy clean coal technology has paid measurable dividends technological innovation introduced through the cct program now provides consumers cost-effective clean coal-based energy 19 clean coal and the environment edit further information environmental effects of coal according to united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change the burning of coal a fossil fuel is a major contributor to global warming see the un ipcc fourth assessment report as 25.5 of the world s electrical generation in 2004 was from coal-fired generation see world energy resources and consumption reaching the carbon dioxide reduction targets of the kyoto protocol will require modifications to how coal is utilized 20 coal which is primarily used for the generation of electricity 21 is the second largest domestic contributor to carbon dioxide emissions in the usa 22 the public has become more concerned about global warming which has led to new legislation the coal industry has responded by running advertising touting clean coal in an effort to counter negative perceptions and claiming more than 50 billion towards the development and deployment of traditional clean coal technologies over the past 30 years and promising 500 million towards carbon capture and storage research and development 23 some in the coal industry who and the u.s department of energy who refer to carbon capture and sequestration ccs as the latest in clean coal technologies the clean coal terminology is generally not endorsed by professionals in ccs and is actively opposed by environmental organizations that favor ccs citation needed ccs is a means to capture carbon dioxide from any source compress it to a dense liquid-like state and inject and permanently store it underground currently there are more than 80 carbon capture and sequestration projects underway in the united states 24 all components of ccs technology have been used for decades in conjunction with enhanced oil recovery and other applications commercial-scale ccs is currently being tested in the u.s and other countries by whom proposed ccs sites are subjected to extensive investigation and monitoring to avoid potential hazards which could include leakage of sequestered co 2 to the atmosphere induced geological instability or contamination of aquifers used for drinking water supplies 25 26 supporters who of clean coal use the great plains synfuels plant to support the technical feasibility of carbon dioxide sequestration carbon dioxide from the coal gasification is shipped to canada where it is injected into the ground to aid in oil recovery supporters who admit that carbon sequestration is expensive 27
