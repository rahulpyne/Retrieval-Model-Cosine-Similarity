renewable energy in kenya wikipedia renewable energy in kenya from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the renewable energy sector in kenya is among the most active in africa in kenya investment grew from virtually zero in 2009 to us 1.3 billion in 2010 across technologies such as wind geothermal small-scale hydro and biofuels this is not saying that kenya was never active in the renewable energy sector kenya is africa s first geothermal power producer 1 and the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita it is still the largest producer of geothermal power in africa today at 200 mw 2 with only one other african country producing geothermal power ethiopia connectivity to the national grid in kenya currently stands at 28 in 2011 kenya was also the first country in africa to open a carbon exchange 3 geothermal power edit worker at olkaria geothermal plant see main article geothermal power in kenya currently geothermal energy accounts for 20 of total installed capacity of the kenyan grid kenya is the first african country to tap geothermal power and the largest producer of geo-energy harnessing power from steam released by hot rocks beneath the rift valley the abundant sun and wind are also being harnessed in a variety of projects of these the lake turkana project is the most audacious both because of the scale and the location 4 kenya has the capacity to produce 10 gw of geothermal energy 5 geothermal has a prominent place in kenya’s overarching development plans these include the vision 2030 the national climate change action plan nccap and the current ‘5000 mw in 40 months initiative’ geothermal power has the potential to provide reliable cost-competitive baseload power with a small carbon footprint and reduces vulnerability to climate by diversifying power supply away from hydropower which currently provides the majority of kenya’s electricity kenya has set out ambitious targets for geothermal energy it aims to expand its geothermal power production capacity to 5,000 mw by 2030 with a medium-term target of installing 1,887 mw by 2017 as of october 2014 kenya has an installed geothermal capacity of approximately 340 mw although there is significant political will and ambition reaching these ambitions is a major challenge 6 hydroelectricity edit see main article hydroelectric power in kenya hydro power accounts for 49.7 of kenya s energy needs source capacity mw capacity  hydro 761 49.7 fossil fuels 525 34.2 geothermal 198 12.9 bagasse cogeneration 26 2.4 wind 5.45 0.36 isolated grid 18 1.15 total 1,533 100 energy portal kenya source 1 wind power edit kengen wind power ngong see main article wind power in kenya solar power edit kenyans are a world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita more kenyans are turning to solar power rather than connections to the country’s electric grid this is due to relatively high connectivity costs to the grid and the abundance of solar power in kenya 7 kenya has several notable solar power distributors including m-kopa with locally adopted payment schemes including pay-as-you-go and microfinance 8 the world bank and international finance corporation ifc have partnered as part of a lighting africa initiative 9 western companies have also helped sponsor efforts to introduce decentralized solar power solutions in the country 10 11 renewable future targets edit kenya aims to produce 19,200 mw against a demand of 15,000 mw by 2030 all this is shown in the table below source 12 source iaea
