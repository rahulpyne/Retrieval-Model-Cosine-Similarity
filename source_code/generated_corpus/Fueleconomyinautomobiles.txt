fuel economy in automobiles wikipedia fuel economy in automobiles from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search fuel consumption monitor from a 2006 honda airwave a 1916 experiment in creating a fuel-saving automobile in the united states the vehicle weighed only 135 pounds 61.2 kg and was an adaptation of a small gasoline engine originally designed to power a bicycle 1 the fuel economy of an automobile is the fuel efficiency relationship between the distance traveled and the amount of fuel consumed by the vehicle consumption can be expressed in terms of volume of fuel to travel a distance or the distance travelled per unit volume of fuel consumed since fuel consumption of vehicles is a significant factor in air pollution and since importation of motor fuel can be a large part of a nation s foreign trade many countries impose requirements for fuel economy different measurement cycles are used to approximate the actual performance of the vehicle the energy in fuel is required to overcome various losses wind resistance tire drag and others in propelling the vehicle and in providing power to vehicle systems such as ignition or air conditioning various measures can be taken to reduce losses at each of the conversions between chemical energy in fuel and kinetic energy of the vehicle driver behavior can affect fuel economy maneuvers such as sudden acceleration and heavy braking waste energy electric cars do not directly burn fuel and so do not have fuel economy per se but equivalence measures such as miles per gallon gasoline equivalent have been created to attempt to compare them units of measure edit mpg to l 100 km conversion chart blue us red imperial gallon fuel economy is the relationship between the distance traveled and fuel consumed fuel economy can be expressed in two ways units of fuel per fixed distance generally expressed as liters per 100 kilometers l 100 km used in most european countries china south africa australia and new zealand british and canadian law allow for the use of either liters per 100 kilometers or miles per imperial gallon 2 3 4 recently the window sticker on new us cars has started displaying the vehicle s fuel consumption in us gallons per 100 miles 5 units of distance per fixed fuel unit miles per gallon mpg is commonly used in the united states the united kingdom and canada alongside l 100 km kilometers per liter km l is more commonly used elsewhere in the americas continental europe asia parts of africa and oceania in arab countries km 20 l which is known as kilometers per tanaka or tanakeh is used where tanaka is a metal container which has a volume of 20 liters both mpg and km l are units of distance per fixed fuel amount the increase of the value represents economic fuel consumption whereas l 100 km is a unit of fuel consumption per a fixed unit of distance the increase of the value represents large bad fuel consumption when the mpg unit is used it is necessary to identify the type of gallon used as the imperial gallon is 4.5 liters and the us gallon is 3.785 liters conversions of units miles per us gallon → l 100 km 235 m p g u s l 100 k m \displaystyle \frac 235 mpg us l 100km l

beginning of the automotive era to around 20-30 6 this is not the only factor in fuel economy the design of automobile as a whole and usage pattern affects the fuel economy published fuel economy is subject to variation between jurisdiction due to variations in testing protocols the average fuel economy for new passenger car in the united states rose from 17 mpg in 1978 to more than 22 mpg in 1982 7 the average fuel economy in 2008 for new cars light trucks and suvs in the united states was 26.4 mpg us 8.9 l 100 km 8 2008 model year cars classified as midsize by the us epa ranged from 11 to 46 mpg us 21 to 5 l 100 km 9 however due to environmental concerns caused by co 2 emissions new eu regulations are being introduced to reduce the average emissions of cars sold beginning in 2012 to 130 g km of co 2 equivalent to 4.5 l 100 km 52 mpg us 63 mpg imp for a diesel-fueled car and 5.0 l 100 km 47 mpg us 56 mpg imp for a gasoline petrol fueled car 10 the average consumption across the fleet is not immediately affected by the new vehicle fuel economy for example australia s car fleet average in 2004 was 11.5 l 100 km 20.5 mpg us 11 compared with the average new car consumption in the same year of 9.3 l 100 km 25.3 mpg us 12 speed and fuel economy studies edit 1997 fuel economy statistics for various us models fuel economy at steady speeds with selected vehicles was studied in 2010 the most recent study 13 indicates greater fuel efficiency at higher speeds than earlier studies for example some vehicles achieve better fuel economy at 100 km h 62 mph rather than at 70 km h 43 mph 13 although not their best economy such as the 1994 oldsmobile cutlass which has its best economy at 90 kilometres per hour 56 mph 8.1 l 100 km 29 mpg us and gets 2 mpg better economy at 105 km h 65 mph than at 72 km h 45 mph 9.4 l 100 km 25 mpg us vs 22 mpg us 11 l 100 km the proportion of driving on high speed roadways varies from 4 in ireland to 41 in the netherlands when the us national maximum speed law s 55 mph 89 km h speed limit was mandated there were complaints that fuel economy could decrease instead of increase the 1997 toyota celica got 1 mpg better fuel-efficiency at 105 km h 65 mph than it did at 65 km h 40 mph 5.41 l 100 km 43.5 mpg us vs 5.53 l 100 km 42.5 mpg us although almost 5 mpg better at 60 mph 97 km h than at 65 mph 105 km h 48.4 mpg us 4.86 l 100 km vs 43.5 mpg us 5.41 l 100 km and its best economy 52.6 mpg us 4.47 l 100 km at only 25 mph 40 km h other vehicles tested had from 1.4 to 20.2 better fuel-efficiency at 90 km h 56 mph vs 105 km h 65 mph their best economy was reached at speeds of 40 to 90 km h 25 to 56 mph see graph 13 officials hoped that the 55 mph 90 km h limit combined with a ban on ornamental lighting no gasoline sales on sunday and a 15 cut in gasoline production would reduce total gas consumption by 200,000 barrels a day representing a 2.2 drop from annualized 1973 gasoline consumption levels 14 a this was partly based on a belief that cars achieve maximum efficiency between 65 and 80 km h 40 and 50 mph and that trucks and buses were most efficient at 55 mph 89 km h 16 in 1998 the u.s transportation research board footnoted an estimate that the 1974 national maximum speed limit nmsl reduced fuel consumption by 0.2 to 1.0 percent 17 rural interstates the roads most visibly affected by the nmsl accounted for 9.5 of the u.s vehicle-miles-traveled in 1973 18 but such free-flowing roads typically provide more fuel-efficient travel than conventional roads 19 20 21 differences in testing standards edit this

june 2007 since the total force opposing the vehicle s motion at constant speed multiplied by the distance through which the vehicle travels represents the work that the vehicle s engine must perform the study of fuel economy the amount of energy consumed per unit of distance traveled requires a detailed analysis of the forces that oppose a vehicle s motion in terms of physics force rate at which the amount of work generated energy delivered varies with the distance traveled or f d w d s ∝ fuel economy \displaystyle f \frac dw ds \propto \text fuel economy note the amount of work generated by the vehicle s power source energy delivered by the engine would be exactly proportional to the amount of fuel energy consumed by the engine if the engine s efficiency is the same regardless of power output but this is not necessarily the case due to the operating characteristics of the internal combustion engine for a vehicle whose source of power is a heat engine an engine that uses heat to perform useful work the amount of fuel energy that a vehicle consumes per unit of distance level road depends upon the thermodynamic efficiency of the heat engine the forces of friction within the mechanical system that delivers engine output to the wheels the forces of friction in the wheels and between the road and the wheels rolling friction other internal forces that the engine works against electrical generator air conditioner water pump engine fan etc external forces that resist motion e.g. wind rain non-regenerative braking force brakes that turn motion energy into heat rather than storing it in a useful form e.g. electrical energy in hybrid vehicles fuel consumed while the engine is on standby and not powering the wheels i.e. while the vehicle is coasting braking or idling 23 energy dissipation in city and highway driving ideally a car traveling at a constant velocity on level ground in a vacuum with frictionless wheels could travel at any speed without consuming any energy beyond what is needed to get the car up to speed less ideally any vehicle must expend energy on overcoming road load forces which consist of aerodynamic drag tire rolling resistance and inertial energy that is lost when the vehicle is decelerated by friction brakes with ideal regenerative braking the inertial energy could be completely recovered but there are few options for reducing aerodynamic drag or rolling resistance other than optimizing the vehicle s shape and the tire design road load energy or the energy demanded at the wheels can be calculated by evaluating the vehicle equation of motion over a specific driving cycle 24 the vehicle powertrain must then provide this minimum energy in order to move the vehicle and will lose a large amount of additional energy in the process of converting fuel energy into work and transmitting it to the wheels overall the sources of energy loss in moving a vehicle may be summarized as follows engine efficiency 20-30 6 which varies with engine type the mass of the automobile and its load and engine speed usually measured in rpm aerodynamic drag force which increases roughly by the square of the car s speed but note that drag power goes by the cube of the car s speed rolling friction braking although regenerative braking captures some of the energy that would otherwise be lost losses in the transmission manual transmissions can be up to 94 efficient whereas older automatic transmissions may be as low as 70 efficient 25 automatically controlled shifting of gearboxes that have the same internals as manual boxes will give the same efficiency as a pure manual gearbox plus the bonus of added intelligence selecting optimal shifting points air conditioning the power required for the engine to turn the compressor decreases the fuel-efficiency though only when in use this may be offset by the reduced drag of the vehicle compared with driving with the windows down the efficiency of ac systems gradually deteriorates due to dirty filters etc regular maintenance prevents this the extra mass of the air conditioning system will cause a slight increase in fuel consumption power steering older hydraulic power steering systems are powered by a hydraulic pump constantly engaged to the engine power assistance required for steering is inversely proportional to the vehicle speed so the constant load on the engine from a hydraulic pump reduces fuel efficiency more modern designs improve fuel efficiency by only activating the power assistance when needed this is done by using either direct electrical power steering assistance or an electrically powered hydraulic pump cooling older cooling systems used a constantly engaged mechanical fan to draw air through the radiator at a rate directly related to the engine speed this constant load reduces efficiency more modern systems use electrical fans to draw additional air through the radiator when extra cooling is required electrical systems headlights battery charging active suspension circulating fans defrosters media systems speakers and other electronics can also significantly increase fuel consumption as the energy to power these devices causes increased load on the alternator since alternators are commonly only 40–60 efficient the added load from electronics on the engine can be as high as 3 horsepower 2.2 kw at any speed including idle in the ftp 75 cycle test a 200 watt load on the alternator reduces fuel efficiency by 1.7 mpg 26 headlights for example consume 110 watts on low and up to 240 watts on high these electrical loads can cause much of the discrepancy between real world and epa tests which only include the electrical loads required to run the engine and basic climate control standby the energy needed to keep the engine running while it is not providing power to the wheels i.e. when stopped coasting or braking fuel-efficiency decreases from electrical loads are most pronounced at lower speeds because most electrical loads are constant while engine load increases with speed so at a lower speed a higher proportion of engine horsepower is used by electrical loads hybrid cars see the greatest effect on fuel-efficiency from electrical loads because of this proportional effect fuel economy-boosting technologies edit main article fuel saving devices engine-specific technology edit

products exist that are purported to increase fuel economy many of these claims have been discredited in the united states the environmental protection agency maintains a list of devices that have been tested by independent laboratories and makes the test results available to the public 30 fuel economy data reliability edit the mandatory publication of the fuel consumption by the manufacturer led some to use dubious practices to reach better values in the past if the test is on a test stand the vehicle may detect open doors and adapt the engine control also when driven according to the test regime the parameters may adapt automatically test laboratories use a golden car that is tested in each one to check that each lab produces the same set of measurements for a given drive cycle 31 tire pressures and lubricants have to be as recommended by the manufacturer higher tire pressures are required on a particular dynamometer type but this is to compensate for the different rolling resistance of the dynamometer not to produce an unrealistic load on the vehicle normally the quoted figures a manufacturer publishes have to be proved by the relevant authority witnessing vehicle engine tests some jurisdictions independently test emissions of vehicles in service and as a final measure can force a recall of all of a particular type of vehicle if the customer vehicles do not fulfill manufacturers claims within reasonable limits the expense and bad publicity from such a recall encourages manufacturers to publish realistic figures the us federal government retests 10–15 of models 32 to make sure that the manufacturer s tests are accurate real world fuel consumption can vary greatly as they can be affected by many factors that have little to do with the vehicle driving conditions – weather traffic temperature driving style – hard braking jack rabbit starts and speeding road conditions – paved vs gravel smooth vs potholes and things like carrying excess weight roof racks and fuel quality can all combine to dramatically increase fuel consumption expecting to consistently perform in the face of so many variables is impossible as is the expectation for one set of numbers to encompass every driver and their personal circumstances the ratings are meant to provide a comparison and are not a promise of actual performance concerns over epa estimates edit for many years critics had claimed that epa estimated fuel economy figures had been misleading the primary arguments of the epa detractors were focused on the lack of real world testing and the very limited scale i.e. city or highway partly as a response to these criticisms the epa changed their fuel economy rating system in 2008 in an attempt to more adequately address these concerns instead of testing simply in two presumed modes the testing now covers 33 faster speeds and acceleration air conditioner use colder outside temperatures while the new epa standards may represent an improvement real world user data may still be the best way to gather and collect accurate fuel economy information as such the epa has also set up a http www.fueleconomy.gov mpg mpg.do action browselist website where drivers can enter and track their own real-world fuel economy numbers there are also a number of websites that attempt to track and report individual user fuel economy data through real-life driving sites or publications such as consumer reports edmunds.com consumer guide and truedelta.com offer this service and claim more accurate numbers than those listed by the epa fuel economy maximizing behaviors edit main article fuel economy-maximizing behaviors governments various environmentalist organizations and companies like toyota and shell oil company have historically urged drivers to maintain adequate air pressure in tires and careful acceleration deceleration habits keeping track of fuel efficiency stimulates fuel economy-maximizing behavior 34 a five-year partnership between michelin and anglian water shows that 60,000 litres fuel can be saved on tyre pressure the anglian water fleet of 4,000 vans and cars are now lasting their full lifetime.this shows the impact that tyre pressures have on the fuel efficiency 35 fuel economy as part of quality management regimes edit environmental management systems emas as well as good fleet management includes record keeping of

manufacturers follow a controlled laboratory testing procedure to generate the fuel consumption data that they submit to the government of canada this controlled method of fuel consumption testing including the use of standardized fuels test cycles and calculations is used instead of on-road driving to ensure that all vehicles are tested under identical conditions and that the results are consistent and repeatable selected test vehicles are “run in” for about 6,000 km before testing the vehicle is then mounted on a chassis dynamometer programmed to take into account the aerodynamic efficiency weight and rolling resistance of the vehicle a trained driver runs the vehicle through standardized driving cycles that simulate trips in the city and on the highway fuel consumption ratings are derived from the emissions generated during the driving cycles 40 the 5 cycle test 1 the city test simulates urban driving in stop-and-go traffic with an average speed of 34 km h and a top speed of 90 km h the test runs for approximately 31 minutes and includes 23 stops the test begins from a cold engine start which is similar to starting a vehicle after it has been parked overnight during the summer the final phase of the test repeats the first eight minutes of the cycle but with a hot engine start this simulates restarting a vehicle after it has been warmed up driven and then stopped for a short time over five minutes of test time are spent idling to represent waiting at traffic lights the ambient temperature of the test cell starts at 20 °c and ends at 30 °c 2 the highway test simulates a mixture of open highway and rural road driving with an average speed of 78 km h and a top speed of 97 km h the test runs for approximately 13 minutes and does not include any stops the test begins from a hot engine start the ambient temperature of the test cell starts at 20 °c and ends at 30 °c 3 in the cold temperature operation test the same driving cycle is used as in the standard city test except that the ambient temperature of the test cell is set to 7 °c 4 in the air conditioning test the ambient temperature of the test cell is raised to 35 °c the vehicle s climate control system is then used to lower the internal cabin temperature starting with a warm engine the test averages 35 km h and reaches a maximum speed of 88 km h five stops are included with idling occurring 19 of the time 5 the high speed quick acceleration test averages 78 km h and reaches a top speed of 129 km h four stops are included and brisk acceleration maximizes at a rate of 13.6 km h

using two drive cycles and corresponding fuel economies are reported as urban and extra-urban in litres per 100 km and in the uk in miles per imperial gallon the urban economy is measured using the test cycle known as ece-15 first introduced in 1970 by ec directive 70 220 ewg and finalized by eec directive 90 c81 01 in 1999 it simulates a 4,052 m 2.518 mile urban trip at an average speed of

advertising standards agency have claimed that fuel consumption figures are misleading often the case with european vehicles as the mpg miles per gallon figures that can be advertised are often not the same as real world driving the asa have said that car manufacturers can use ‘cheats’ to prepare their vehicles for their compulsory fuel efficiency and emissions tests in a way set out to make themselves look as ‘clean’ as possible this practice is common in petrol and diesel vehicle tests but hybrid and electric vehicles are not immune as manufacturers apply these techniques to fuel efficiency car experts who also assert that the official mpg figures given by manufacturers do not represent the true mpg values from real-world driving 47 websites have been set up to show the real-world mpg figures based on crowd-sourced data from real users vs the official mpg figures 48 the major loopholes in the current eu tests allow car manufacturers a number of ‘cheats’ to improve results car manufacturers can disconnect the alternator thus no energy is used to recharge the battery use special lubricants that are not used in production cars in order to reduce friction turn off all electrical gadgets i.e air con radio adjust brakes or even disconnect them to reduce friction tape up cracks between body panels and windows to reduce air resistance remove wing mirrors 49 according to the results of a 2014 study by the international council on clean transportation icct the gap between official and real-world fuel-economy figures in europe has risen to about 38 in 2013 from 10 in 2001 the analysis found that for private cars the difference between on-road and official co 2 values rose from around 8 in 2001 to 31 in 2013 and 45 for company cars in 2013 the report is based on data from more than half a million private and company vehicles across europe the analysis was prepared by the icct together with the netherlands organisation for applied scientific research

manufacturers for new cars the jc08 test is significantly longer and more rigorous than the 10–15 mode test the running pattern with jc08 stretches out to 1200 seconds 20 minutes and there are both cold and warm start measurements and top speed is 82 km h 51.0 mph the economy ratings of the jc08 are lower than the 10–15 mode cycle but they are expected to be more real world 51 the toyota prius became the first car to meet japan’s new 2015 fuel economy standards measured under the jc08 test 53 new zealand edit starting on 7 april 2008 all cars of up to 3.5 tonnes gvw sold other than private sale need to have a fuel economy sticker applied if available that shows the rating from one half star to six stars with the most economic cars having the most stars and the more fuel hungry cars the least along with the fuel economy in l 100 km and the estimated annual fuel cost for driving 14,000 km at present fuel prices the stickers must also appear on vehicles to be leased for more than 4 months all new cars currently rated range from 6.9 l 100 km 41 mpg imp 34 mpg us to 3.8 l 100 km 74 mpg imp 62 mpg us and received respectively from 4.5 to 5.5 stars 54 united states edit motor vehicle fuel economy from 1966 to 2008 us energy tax act edit main article energy tax act the energy tax act of 1978 55 in the us established a gas guzzler tax on the sale of new model year vehicles whose fuel economy fails to meet certain statutory levels the tax applies only to cars not trucks and is collected by the irs its purpose is to discourage the production and purchase of fuel-inefficient vehicles the tax was phased in over ten years with rates increasing over time it applies only to manufacturers and importers of vehicles although presumably some or all of the tax is passed along to automobile consumers in the form of higher prices only new vehicles are subject to the tax so no tax is imposed on used car sales the tax is graduated to apply a higher tax rate for less-fuel-efficient vehicles to determine the tax rate manufacturers test all the vehicles at their laboratories for fuel economy the us environmental protection agency confirms a portion of those tests at an epa lab in some cases this tax may only apply to certain variants of a given model for example the 2004–2006 pontiac gto captive import version of the holden monaro did incur the tax when ordered with the four-speed automatic transmission but did not incur the tax when ordered with the six-speed manual transmission 56 epa testing procedure through 2007 edit the city or urban dynamometer driving schedule udds used in the epa federal test procedure the highway fuel economy driving cycle hwfet used in the epa federal test procedure two separate fuel economy tests simulate city driving and highway driving the city driving program or urban dynamometer driving schedule or udds or ftp-72 is defined in 40 c.f.r 86 app i and consists of starting with a cold engine and making 23 stops over a period of 31 minutes for an average speed of 20 mph 32 km h and with a top speed of 56 mph 90 km h the highway program or highway fuel economy driving schedule hwfet is defined in 40 c.f.r 600 app i and uses a warmed-up engine and makes no stops averaging 48 mph 77 km h with a top speed of 60 mph 97 km h over a 10-mile 16 km distance the measurements are then adjusted downward by 10 city and 22 highway to more accurately reflect real-world results a weight average of city 55 and highway 45 fuel economies is used to determine the guzzler tax 57 58 the procedure has been updated to ftp-75 adding a hot start cycle which repeats the cold start cycle after a 10-minute pause because epa figures had almost always indicated better efficiency than real-world fuel-efficiency the epa has modified the method starting with 2008 updated estimates are available for vehicles back to the 1985 model year 57 59 epa testing procedure 2008 and beyond edit 2008 monroney sticker highlights fuel economy us epa altered the testing procedure effective my2008 which adds three new supplemental federal test procedure sftp tests to include the influence of higher driving speed harder acceleration colder temperature and air conditioning use 60 sftp us06 is a high speed quick acceleration loop that lasts 10 minutes covers 8 miles 13 km averages 48 mph 77 km h and reaches a top speed of 80 mph 130 km h four stops are included and brisk acceleration maximizes at a rate of 8.46 mph 13.62 km h per second the engine begins warm and air conditioning is not used ambient temperature varies between 68 °f 20 °c to 86 °f 30 °c sfto sc03 is the air conditioning test which raises ambient temperatures to 95 °f 35 °c and puts the vehicle s climate control system to use lasting 9.9 minutes the 3.6-mile 5.8 km loop averages 22 mph 35 km h and maximizes at a rate of 54.8 mph 88.2 km h five stops are included idling occurs 19 percent of the time and acceleration of 5.1 mph sec is achieved engine temperatures begin warm lastly a cold temperature cycle uses the same parameters as the current city loop except that ambient temperature is set to 20 °f −7 °c epa tests for fuel economy do not include electrical load tests beyond climate control which may account for some of the discrepancy between epa and real world fuel-efficiency a 200 w electrical load can produce a 0.4 km l 0.94 mpg reduction in efficiency on the ftp 75 cycle test 26 electric vehicles and hybrids edit 2010 monroney sticker for a plug-in hybrid showing fuel economy in all-electric mode and gas-only mode following the efficiency claims made for vehicles such as chevrolet volt and nissan leaf the national renewable energy laboratory recommended to use epa s new vehicle fuel efficiency formula that gives different values depending on fuel used 61 in november 2010 the epa introduced the first fuel economy ratings in the monroney stickers for plug-in electric vehicles for the fuel economy label of the chevy volt plug-in hybrid epa rated the car separately for all-electric mode expressed in miles per gallon gasoline equivalent mpg-e and for gasoline-only mode expressed in conventional miles per gallon epa also estimated an overall combined city highway gas-electricity fuel economy rating expressed in miles per gallon gasoline equivalent mpg-e the label also includes a table showing fuel economy and electricity consumed for five different scenarios 30 miles 48 km 45 miles 72 km 60 miles 97 km and 75 miles 121 km driven between a full charge and a never charge scenario this information was included in order to make the consumers aware of the variability of the fuel economy outcome depending on miles driven between charges also the fuel economy for a gasoline-only scenario never charge was included for electric-only mode the energy consumption estimated in kwh per 100 miles 160 km is also shown 62 63 2010 monroney label showing the epa s combined city highway fuel economy equivalent for an all electric car for the fuel economy label of the nissan leaf electric car epa rated the combined fuel economy in terms of miles per gallon gasoline equivalent with a separate rating for city and highway driving this fuel economy equivalence is based on the energy consumption estimated in kwh per 100 miles and also shown in the monroney label 64 in may 2011 the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa and epa issued a joint final rule establishing new requirements for a fuel economy and environment label that is mandatory for all new passenger cars and trucks starting with model year 2013 and voluntary for 2012 models the ruling includes new labels for alternative fuel and alternative propulsion vehicles available in the us market such as plug-in hybrids electric vehicles flexible-fuel vehicles hydrogen fuel cell vehicle and natural gas vehicles 65 66 the common fuel economy metric adopted to allow the comparison of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles is miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent mpge a gallon of gasoline equivalent means the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity cubic feet of compressed natural gas cng or kilograms of hydrogen that is equal to the energy in a gallon of gasoline 65 the new labels also include for the first time an estimate of how much fuel or electricity it takes to drive 100 miles 160 km providing us consumers with fuel consumption per distance traveled the metric commonly used in many other countries epa explained that the objective is to avoid the traditional miles per gallon metric that can be potentially misleading when consumers compare fuel economy improvements and known as the mpg illusion 67 – this illusion arises because the reciprocal i.e non-linear relationship between cost equivalently volume of fuel consumed per unit distance driven and mpg value means that differences in mpg values are not directly meaningful – only ratios are in mathematical terms the reciprocal function does not commute with addition and subtraction in general a difference in reciprocal values is not equal to the reciprocal of their difference it has been claimed that many consumers are unaware of this and therefore compare mpg values by subtracting them which can give a misleading picture of relative differences in fuel economy between different pairs of vehicles – for instance an increase from 10 to 20 mpg corresponds to a 100 improvement in fuel economy whereas an increase from 50 to 60 mpg is only a 20 improvement although in both cases the difference is 10 mpg 68 the epa explained that the new gallons-per-100-miles metric provides a more accurate measure of fuel efficiency 65 69 – notably it is equivalent to the normal metric measurement of fuel economy liters per 100 kilometers l 100 km cafe standards edit curve of average car mileage for model years between 1978-2014 main article corporate average fuel economy the corporate average fuel economy cafe regulations in the united states first enacted by congress in 1975 70 are federal regulations intended to improve the average fuel economy of cars and light trucks trucks vans and sport utility vehicles sold in the us in the wake of the 1973 arab oil embargo historically it is the sales-weighted average fuel economy of a manufacturer s fleet of current model year passenger cars or light trucks manufactured for sale in the united states under truck cafe standards 2008–2011 this changes to a footprint model where larger trucks are allowed to consume more fuel the standards were limited to vehicles under a certain weight but those weight classes were expanded in 2011 state regulations edit the states are pre-empted by federal law and are not allowed to make fuel efficiency standards however california has a special dispensation from the clean air act to make emissions standards which other states may adopt instead of the federal standards the california air resources board is implementing some legislation that limits greenhouse gas emissions a legal dispute has emerged over whether this is effectually a fuel
