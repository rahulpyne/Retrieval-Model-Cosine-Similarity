been debate on the role that increased international trade has played in increasing pollution 2 while some maintain that increases in pollution which result in both local environmental degradation and a global tragedy of the commons are intimately linked to increases in international trade others have argued that as citizens become more affluent they ll also advocate for cleaner environments according to a world bank paper since freer trade raises income it directly contributes to increasing pollution levels via the scale effect however it thereby induces the composition and technique effects of increased income both of which tend to reduce pollution levels 3 4 early tariff implementation proposal edit although the united states has in the past been accused of dragging its feet on implementing tough new anti-pollution measures it was the originator of a legislative proposal suggesting an environmental tariff be applied against exporting countries whose exports gained significant cost advantages due to less stringent environmental regulations the proposed legislation was tabled as the international pollution deterrence act of 1991 and was introduced in its senate in april of that year 5 proposed international pollution control index edit a notable feature of the proposed u.s international pollution deterrence act was the international pollution control index it cited within its section 5 which read 6 international pollution control index section 8002 of the solid waste disposal act 42 u.s.c 6982 is amended by adding the following new subsections at the end thereof ` t the administrator shall prepare within one hundred and twenty days of the enactment of this section and yearly thereafter a pollution control index for each of the top fifty countries identified by the office of trade and investment of the department of commerce based on the value of exports to the united states from that country s attainment of pollution control standards in the areas of air water hazardous waste and solid waste as compared to the united states the purpose of this index is to measure the level of compliance within each country with standards comparable to or greater than those in the united states the administrator shall analyze in particular the level of technology employed and actual costs incurred for pollution control in the major export sectors of each country in formulating the index agitation against use of environmental tariffs edit environment tariffs were not implemented in the past in part because they were not sanctioned by multilateral trade regimes such as the world trade organization and within the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt a fact which generated considerable criticism and calls for reform 1 additionally many foreign factory owners in newly industrialized countries and underdeveloped countries saw the attempts to impose pollution controls on them as suspicious.. seeing it as a threat to their growth and fearing that developed countries would attempt to export their preferences for pollution control or to place environmental tariffs on imports from countries with lower standards 7
