etymology the origins of the roman name hispania from which the modern name españa was derived are uncertain due to inadequate evidence down the centuries there have been a number of accounts and hypotheses lady of elche the renaissance scholar antonio de nebrija proposed that the word hispania evolved from the iberian word hispalis meaning city of the western world jesús luis cunchillos argues that the root of the term span is the phoenician word spy meaning to forge metals therefore i-spn-ya would mean the land where metals are forged 9 it may be a derivation of the phoenician i-shpania meaning island of rabbits land of rabbits or edge a reference to spain s location at the end of the mediterranean roman coins struck in the region from the reign of hadrian show a female figure with a rabbit at her feet 10 and strabo called it the land of the rabbits 11 hispania may derive from the poetic use of the term hesperia reflecting the greek perception of italy as a western land or land of the setting sun hesperia Ἑσπερία in greek and spain being still further west as hesperia ultima 12 there is the claim that hispania derives from the basque word ezpanna meaning edge or border another reference to the fact that the iberian peninsula constitutes the southwest corner of the european continent 12 two 15th-century spanish jewish scholars don isaac abrabanel and solomon ibn verga gave an explanation now considered folkloric both men wrote in two different published works that the first jews to reach spain were brought by ship by phiros who was confederate with the

written records as a land populated largely by the iberians basques and celts after an arduous conquest the peninsula came under the rule of the roman empire during the early middle ages it came under germanic rule but later much of it was conquered by moorish invaders from north africa in a process that took centuries the small christian kingdoms in the north gradually regained control of the peninsula the last moorish kingdom fell in the same year columbus reached the americas a global empire began which saw spain become the strongest kingdom in europe the leading world power for a century and a half and the largest overseas empire for three centuries continued wars and other problems eventually led to a diminished status the napoleonic invasions of spain led to chaos triggering independence movements that tore apart most of the empire and left the country politically unstable prior to the second world war spain suffered a devastating civil war and came under the rule of an

settlements are the famous paintings in the altamira cave of cantabria in northern iberia which were created from 35,600 to 13,500 bce by cro-magnon 14 17 archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that the iberian peninsula acted as one of several major refugia from which northern europe was repopulated following the end of the last ice age the largest groups inhabiting the iberian peninsula before the roman conquest were the iberians and the celts the iberians inhabited the mediterranean side of the peninsula from the northeast to the southeast the celts inhabited much of the inner and atlantic sides of the peninsula from the northwest to the southwest basques occupied the western area of the pyrenees mountain range and adjacent areas the tartessians were in the southwest and the

with the sarmatian alans crossed the rhine and ravaged gaul until the visigoths drove them into iberia that same year the suebi established a kingdom in what is today modern galicia and northern portugal as the western empire disintegrated the social and economic base became greatly simplified but even in modified form the successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire including christianity and assimilation to the evolving roman culture the alans allies the hasdingi vandals established a kingdom in gallaecia too occupying largely the same region but extending farther south to the douro river the silingi vandals occupied the region that still bears a form of their name— vandalusia modern andalusia in spain the byzantines established an enclave

the time were averroes ibn arabi and maimonides the romanised cultures of the iberian peninsula interacted with muslim and jewish cultures in complex ways giving the region a distinctive culture 23

century of successes that partially reversed christian gains basilica of san isidoro león the reconquista reconquest was the centuries-long period in which christian rule was re-established over the iberian peninsula the reconquista is viewed as beginning with the battle of covadonga won by don pelayo in 722 and was concurrent with the period of muslim rule on the iberian peninsula the christian army s victory over muslim forces led to the creation of the christian kingdom of asturias along the northwestern coastal mountains shortly after in 739 muslim forces were driven from galicia which was to eventually host one of medieval europe s holiest sites santiago de compostela and was incorporated into the new christian kingdom the kingdom of león was the strongest christian kingdom for

remnant of a 781-year presence of islamic rule in iberia that same year spain s jews were ordered to convert to catholicism or face expulsion from spanish territories during the spanish inquisition 31 the treaty of granada guaranteed religious tolerance towards muslims 32 and although the tolerance was only partial it was not until the beginning of the 17th century following the revolt of the alpujarras that muslims were finally expelled k 33 the year 1492 also marked the arrival of christopher columbus in the new world during a voyage funded by isabella columbus s first voyage crossed the

crowns of aragon and castile by the marriage of their sovereigns laid the basis for modern spain and the spanish empire although each kingdom of spain remained a separate country in social political laws currency and language 34 35 spain was europe s leading power throughout the 16th century and most of the 17th century a position reinforced by trade and wealth from colonial possessions and became the world s leading maritime power it reached its apogee during the reigns of the first two spanish habsburgs — charles i 1516–1556 and philip ii 1556–1598 this period saw the italian wars the revolt of the comuneros the dutch revolt the morisco revolt clashes with the ottomans the anglo-spanish war and wars with france 36 anachronous map of the spanish empire including territorial claims through exploration and conquest or royal marriage alliances and inheritance the spanish empire expanded to include vast areas in the americas islands in the asia-pacific area areas of italy cities in northern africa as well as parts of what are now france germany belgium luxembourg and the netherlands the first circumnavigation of the world was carried out in 1519–1521 it was the first empire on which it was said that the sun never set this was an age of discovery with daring explorations by sea and by land the opening-up of new trade routes across oceans conquests and the beginnings of european colonialism spanish explorers brought back precious metals spices luxuries and previously unknown plants and played a leading part in transforming the european understanding of the globe 37 the cultural efflorescence witnessed during this period is now referred to as the spanish golden age the expansion of the empire caused immense upheaval in the americas as the collapse of societies and empires and new diseases from europe devastated american indigenous populations the rise of humanism the counter-reformation and new geographical discoveries and conquests raised issues that were addressed by the intellectual movement now known as the school of salamanca which developed the first modern theories of what are now known as international law and human rights philip ii and charles v habsburg spain charles was also emperor of the holy roman empire in the late 16th century and first half of the 17th century spain was confronted by unrelenting challenges from all sides barbary pirates under the aegis of the rapidly growing ottoman empire disrupted life in many coastal areas through their slave raids and the renewed threat of an islamic invasion 38 this was at a time when spain was often at war with france the protestant reformation dragged the kingdom ever more deeply into the mire of religiously charged wars the result was a country forced into ever expanding military efforts across europe and in the mediterranean 39 by the middle decades of a war and plague ridden 17th-century europe the spanish habsburgs had enmeshed the country in continent-wide religious-political conflicts these conflicts drained it of resources and undermined the economy generally spain managed to hold on to most of the scattered habsburg empire and help the imperial forces of the holy roman empire reverse a large part of the advances made by protestant forces but it was finally forced to recognise the separation of portugal with whom it had been united in a personal union of the crowns from 1580 to 1640 and the netherlands and eventually suffered some serious military reverses to france in the latter stages of the immensely destructive europe-wide thirty years war 40 the family of philip v 1743 during the enlightenment in spain a new royal family reigned the house of bourbon in the latter half of the 17th century spain went into a gradual decline during which it surrendered several small territories to france and the netherlands however it maintained and enlarged its vast overseas empire which remained intact until the beginning of the 19th century the decline culminated in a controversy over succession to the throne which consumed the first years of the 18th century the war of the spanish succession was a wide-ranging international conflict combined with a civil war and was to cost the kingdom its european possessions and its position as one of the leading powers on the continent 41 during this war a new dynasty originating in france the bourbons was installed long united only by the crown a true spanish state was established when the first bourbon king philip v united the crowns of castile and aragon into a single state abolishing many of the old regional privileges and laws 42 the 18th century saw a gradual recovery and an increase in prosperity through much of the empire the new bourbon monarchy drew on the french system of modernising the administration and the economy enlightenment ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdom s elite and monarchy military assistance for the rebellious british colonies in the american war of independence improved the kingdom s international standing 43 liberalism and nation state main articles mid-19th-century spain spanish american wars of independence and spanish–american war the third of may 1808 by francisco de goya depicts an episode of the spanish independence war in 1793 spain went to war against the revolutionary new french republic as a member of the first coalition the subsequent war of the pyrenees polarised the country in a reaction against the gallicised elites and following defeat in the field peace was made with france in 1795 at the peace of basel in which spain lost control over two-thirds of the island of hispaniola the prime minister manuel godoy then ensured that spain allied herself with france in the brief war of the third coalition which ended with the british victory at the battle of trafalgar in 1805 in 1807 a secret treaty between napoleon and the unpopular prime minister led to a new declaration of war against britain and portugal napoleon s troops entered the country to invade portugal but instead occupied spain s major fortresses the ridiculed spanish king abdicated in favour of napoleon s brother joseph bonaparte joseph bonaparte was seen as a puppet monarch and was regarded with scorn by the spanish the 2 may 1808 revolt was one of many nationalist uprisings across the country against the bonapartist regime 44 these revolts marked the beginning of a devastating war of independence against the napoleonic regime 45 napoleon was forced to intervene personally defeating several spanish armies and forcing a british army to retreat however further military action by spanish armies guerrillas and wellington s british-portuguese forces combined with napoleon s disastrous invasion of russia led to the ousting of the french imperial armies from spain in 1814 and the return of king ferdinand vii 46 during the war in 1810 a revolutionary body the cortes of cádiz was assembled to co-ordinate the effort against the bonapartist regime and to prepare a constitution 47 it met as one body and its members represented the entire spanish empire 48 in 1812 a constitution for universal representation under a constitutional monarchy was declared but after the fall of the bonapartist regime ferdinand vii dismissed the cortes generales and was determined to rule as an absolute monarch these events foreshadowed the conflict between conservatives and liberals in the 19th and early 20th centuries the proclamation of the spanish constitution of 1812 in cádiz spain s conquest by france benefited latin american anti-colonialists who resented the imperial spanish government s policies that favoured spanish-born citizens peninsulars over those born overseas criollos and demanded retroversion of the sovereignty to the people starting in 1809 spain s american colonies began a series of revolutions and declared independence leading to the spanish american wars of independence that ended spanish control over its mainland colonies in the americas king ferdinand vii s attempt to re-assert control proved futile as he faced opposition not only in the colonies but also in spain and army revolts followed led by liberal officers by the end of 1826 the only american colonies spain held were cuba and puerto rico the napoleonic war left spain economically ruined deeply divided and politically unstable in the 1830s and 1840s anti-liberal forces known as carlists fought against liberals in the carlist wars liberal forces won but the conflict between progressive and conservative liberals ended in a weak early constitutional period after the glorious revolution of 1868 and the short-lived first spanish republic a more stable monarchic period began characterised by

republican side which was supported by the soviet union mexico and international brigades but it was not supported by the western powers due to the british-led policy of non-intervention the civil war was viciously fought and there were many atrocities committed by all sides the war claimed the lives of over 500,000 people and caused the flight of up to a half-million citizens from the country 49

in 1937 the party emphasised falangism a form of fascism that emphasised anti-communism nationalism and roman catholicism given franco s opposition to competing political parties the party was renamed the national movement movimiento nacional in 1949 after world war ii spain was politically and economically isolated and was kept out of the united nations this changed in 1955 during the cold war period when it became strategically important for the us to establish a military presence on the iberian peninsula as a counter to any possible move by the soviet union into the mediterranean basin in the 1960s spain registered an unprecedented rate of economic growth which was propelled by industrialisation a mass internal migration from rural areas to cities and the creation of a mass tourism industry franco s rule was also characterised by authoritarianism promotion of a unitary national identity the favouring of a very conservative form of roman catholicism known as national catholicism

people and nationalisms and regionalisms of spain asturian folk musicians with bagpipes the spanish constitution of 1978 in its second article recognises historic entities— nationalities a carefully chosen word to avoid the more politically charged nations —and regions within the context of the spanish nation for some people spain s identity consists more of an overlap of different regional identities than of a sole spanish identity indeed some of the regional identities may even conflict with the spanish one distinct traditional regional identities within spain include the basques catalans galicians andalusians and valencians 140 although to some extent all of the 17 autonomous communities will claim a distinct historic identity it is this last feature of shared identity between the more local level or autonomous community and the spanish level which makes the identity question in spain complex and far from univocal minority groups spain has a number of descendants of populations from former colonies especially latin america and north africa smaller numbers of immigrants from several sub-saharan countries have recently been settling in spain there are also sizeable numbers of asian immigrants most of whom are of middle eastern south asian and chinese origin the single largest group of immigrants are european represented by large numbers of britons germans french and others 141 ceuta and melilla have a big population of north african ancestry the arrival of the gitanos a romani people began in the 16th century estimates of the spanish gitano population range from 750,000 to over one million 142 143 144 145 146 there are also the mercheros also quinquis a formerly nomadic minority group their origin is unclear historically sephardi jews and moriscos are the main minority groups originated in spain and with a contribution to spanish culture 147 the spanish government is offering spanish nationality to sephardi jews 148 immigration main article immigration to spain marbella málaga where britons—who are the third biggest immigrant community in spain—reside in large numbers according to the spanish government there were 5.7 million foreign residents in spain in 2011 or 12 of the total population according to residence permit data for 2011 more than 860,000 were romanian about 770,000 were moroccan approximately 390,000 were british and 360,000 were ecuadorian 149 other sizeable foreign communities are colombian bolivian german italian bulgarian and chinese there are more than 200,000 migrants from sub-saharan africa living in spain principally senegaleses and nigerians 150 since 2000 spain has experienced high population growth as a result of immigration flows despite a birth rate that is only half the replacement level this sudden and ongoing inflow of immigrants particularly those arriving illegally by sea has caused noticeable social tension 151 palma de mallorca where a large population of germans live within the eu spain had the 2nd highest immigration rate in percentage terms after cyprus but by a great margin the highest in absolute numbers up to 2008 152 the number of immigrants in spain had grown up from 500,000 people in 1996 to 5.2 million in 2008 out of a total population of 46 million 153 154 in 2005 alone a regularisation programme increased the legal immigrant population by 700,000 people 155 there are a number of reasons for the high level of immigration including spain s cultural ties with latin america its geographical position the porosity of its borders the large size of its underground economy and the strength of the agricultural and construction sectors which demand more low cost labour than can be offered by the national workforce another statistically significant factor is the large number of residents of eu origin typically retiring to spain s mediterranean coast in fact spain was europe s largest absorber of migrants from 2002 to 2007 with its immigrant population more than doubling as 2.5 million people arrived 156 in 2008 prior to the onset of the economic crisis the financial times reported that spain was the most favoured destination for western europeans considering a move from their own country and seeking jobs elsewhere in the eu 157 in 2008 the government instituted a plan of voluntary return which encouraged unemployed immigrants from outside the eu to return to their home countries and receive several incentives including the right to keep their unemployment benefits and transfer whatever they contributed to the spanish social security 158 the programme had little effect during its first two months just 1,400 immigrants took up the offer 159 what the programme failed to do the sharp and prolonged economic crisis has done from 2010 to 2011 in that tens of thousands of immigrants have left the country due to lack of jobs in 2011 alone more than half a million people left spain 160 for the first time in decades the net

hindus buddhists sikhs and muslims after the reconquista in 1492 muslims did not live in spain for centuries late 19th-century colonial expansion in northwestern africa gave a number of residents in

period for spanish culture we are in the times of the spanish empire the famous don quijote de la mancha by miguel de cervantes was written in this time other writers from the period are francisco de

pelayo realism offered depictions of contemporary life and society as they were in the spirit of general realism realist authors opted for depictions of everyday and banal activities and experiences instead of romanticised or stylised presentations the group that has become known as the generation of 1898 was marked by the destruction of spain s fleet in cuba by us gunboats in 1898 which provoked a cultural crisis in spain the disaster of 1898 led established writers to seek practical political economic and social solutions in essays grouped under the literary heading of regeneracionismo for a group of younger writers among them miguel de unamuno pío baroja and josé martínez ruiz azorín the disaster and its cultural repercussions inspired a deeper more radical literary shift that affected both form and content these writers along with ramón del valle-inclán antonio machado ramiro de maeztu and Ángel ganivet came to be known as the generation of 98 miguel de unamuno josé ortega y gasset and federico garcía lorca the generation of 1914 or novecentismo the next supposed generation of spanish writers following those of 98 already calls into question the value of such terminology by the year 1914—the year of the outbreak of the first world war and of the publication of the first major work of the generation s leading voice josé ortega y gasset —a number of slightly younger writers had established their own place within the spanish cultural field leading voices include the poet juan ramón jiménez the academics and essayists ramón menéndez pidal gregorio marañón manuel azaña maria zambrano eugeni d ors clara campoamor and ortega y gasset and the novelists gabriel miró ramón pérez de ayala and ramón gómez de la serna while still driven by the national and existential questions that obsessed the writers of 98 they approached these topics with a greater sense of distance and objectivity salvador de madariaga another prominent intellectual and writer was one of the founders of the college of europe and the composer of the constitutive manifest of the liberal international the generation of 1927 where poets pedro salinas jorge guillén federico garcía lorca vicente aleixandre dámaso alonso all were scholars of their national literary heritage again evidence of the impact of the calls of regeneracionistas and the generation of 1898 for spanish

diversity spanish architecture has drawn from a host of influences an important provincial city founded by the romans and with an extensive roman era infrastructure córdoba became the cultural capital including fine arabic style architecture during the time of the islamic umayyad dynasty 181 later arab style architecture continued to be developed under successive islamic dynasties ending with the nasrid which built its famed palace complex in granada simultaneously the christian kingdoms gradually emerged and developed their own styles developing a pre-romanesque style when for a while isolated from contemporary mainstream european architectural influences during the earlier middle ages they later integrated the romanesque and gothic streams there was then an extraordinary flowering of the gothic style that resulted in numerous instances being built throughout the entire territory the mudéjar style from the 12th to 17th centuries was developed by introducing arab style motifs patterns and elements into european architecture the arrival of modernism in the academic arena produced much of the architecture of the 20th century an influential style centred in barcelona known as
