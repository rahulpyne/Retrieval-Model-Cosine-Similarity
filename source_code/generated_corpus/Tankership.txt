december 2015 a tanker or tank ship or tankship is a merchant vessel designed to transport liquids or gases in bulk major types of tankship include the oil tanker the chemical tanker and gas carrier in the united states navy and military sealift command any type of tanker used to refuel other ships is called an oiler background edit tankers can range in size of capacity from several hundred tons which includes vessels for servicing small harbours and coastal settlements to several hundred thousand tons for long-range haulage besides ocean or seagoing tankers there are also specialized inland-waterway tankers which operate on rivers and canals with an average cargo capacity up to some thousand tons a wide range of products are carried by tankers including hydrocarbon products such as oil liquefied petroleum gas lpg and liquefied natural gas lng chemicals such as ammonia chlorine and styrene monomer fresh water wine molasses the thomas w lawson 1902 converted in 1906 into the world s first sailing tanker tankers are a relatively new concept dating from the later years of the 19th century before this technology had simply not supported the idea of carrying bulk liquids the market was also not geared towards transporting or selling cargo in bulk therefore most ships carried a wide range of different products in different holds and traded outside fixed routes liquids were usually loaded in casks—hence the term tonnage which refers to the volume of the holds in terms of how many tuns or casks of wine could be carried even potable water vital for the survival of the crew was stowed in casks carrying bulk liquids in earlier ships posed several problems the holds on timber ships the holds were not sufficiently water oil or air-tight to prevent a liquid cargo from spoiling or leaking the development of iron and steel hulls solved this problem loading and discharging bulk liquids must be pumped the development of efficient pumps and piping systems was vital to the development of the tanker steam engines were developed as prime-movers for early pumping systems dedicated cargo handling facilities were now required ashore too as was a market for receiving a product in that quantity casks could be unloaded using ordinary cranes and the awkward nature of the casks meant that the volume of liquid was always relatively small therefore keeping the market more stable free surface effect a large body of liquid carried aboard a ship will impact on the ship s stability particularly when the liquid is flowing around the hold or tank in response to the ship s movements the effect was negligible in casks but could cause capsizing if the tank extended the width of the ship a problem solved by extensive subdivision of the tanks tankers were first used by the oil industry to transfer refined fuel in bulk from refineries to customers this would then be stored in large tanks ashore and subdivided for delivery to individual locations the use of tankers caught on because other liquids were also cheaper to transport in bulk store in dedicated terminals then subdivide even the guinness brewery used tankers to transport the stout across the irish sea a us navy t2 tanker in 1943 different products require different handling and transport with specialised variants such as chemical tankers oil tankers and lng carriers developed to handle dangerous chemicals oil and oil-derived products and liquefied natural gas respectively these broad variants may be further differentiated with respect to ability to carry only a single product or simultaneously transport mixed cargoes such as several different chemicals or refined petroleum products 1 among oil tankers supertankers are designed for transporting oil around the horn of africa from the middle east the supertanker seawise giant scrapped in 2010 was 458 meters 1,503 ft in length and 69 meters 226 ft wide supertankers are one of the three preferred methods for transporting large quantities of oil along with pipeline transport and rail despite being highly regulated tankers have been involved in environmental disasters resulting from oil spills see amoco cadiz braer erika exxon valdez prestige oil spill and torrey canyon for examples of coastal accidents design considerations edit many modern tankers are designed for a specific cargo and a specific route draft is typically limited by the depth of water in loading and unloading harbors and may be limited by the depth of straits along the preferred shipping route cargoes with high vapor pressure at ambient temperatures may require pressurized tanks or vapor recovery systems tank heaters may be required to maintain heavy crude oil residual fuel asphalt wax or molasses in a fluid state for offloading 2 tanker capacity edit tankers used for liquid fuels are classified according to their capacity the small coastal tanker pegasus on the river weser the very large crude carrier vlcc mv sirius star in 2008 after her capture by somali pirates in 1954 shell oil developed the average freight rate assessment afra system which classifies tankers of different sizes to make it an independent instrument shell consulted

singapore 274 and the bahamas 215 these flag states are also the top six in terms of fleet size in terms of deadweight tonnage 5 largest fleets greece japan and the united states are the top three owners of tankers including those owned but registered to other nations with 733 394 and 311 vessels respectively these three nations account for 1,438 vessels or over 36 of the world s fleet 5
