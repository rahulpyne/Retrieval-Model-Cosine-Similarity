additional deaths and an additional 10 million in property damage repercussions of the sequence of earthquakes were still being felt in the heavily damaged downtown area of bakersfield well into the 1990s as city leaders attempted to improve safety of the surviving non-reinforced masonry buildings following the event a field survey was conducted along the fault zone with the goal of estimating the peak ground acceleration of the shock based on visually evaluating precarious rock formations and other indicators ground disturbances that were created by the earthquakes were also surveyed both in the valley and in the foothills with both vertical and horizontal displacements present in the epicenter area the strong motion records that were acquired from the event were significant and a
