boundaries of cambridge and other massachusetts cities and towns the site for what would become cambridge was chosen in december 1630 because it was located safely upriver from boston harbor which made it easily defensible from attacks by enemy ships thomas dudley his daughter anne bradstreet and her husband simon were among the first settlers of the town the first houses were built in the spring of 1631 the settlement was initially referred to as the newe towne 5 6 official massachusetts records show the name capitalized as newe towne by 1632 and a single word newtowne by 1638 6 7 located at the first convenient charles river crossing west of boston newe towne was one of a number of towns including boston dorchester watertown and weymouth founded by the 700 original puritan colonists of the massachusetts bay colony under governor john winthrop its first preacher was thomas hooker who led many of its original inhabitants west to found the connecticut colony before leaving however they sold their plots to more recent immigrants from england 5 the original village site is in the heart of today s harvard square the marketplace where farmers brought in crops from surrounding towns to sell survives today as the small park at the corner of john f kennedy and winthrop streets then at the edge of a salt marsh and since filled the town included a much larger area than the present city 5 with various outlying parts becoming independent towns over the years cambridge village later newtown and now newton in 1688 8 cambridge farms now lexington in 1712 5 or 1713 9 and little or south cambridge now brighton n 1 and menotomy or west cambridge now arlington in 1807 5 10 n 2 in the late 19th century various schemes for annexing cambridge itself to the city of boston were pursued and rejected 11 12 in 1636 the newe college later renamed harvard college after benefactor john harvard was founded by the colony to train ministers newe towne was chosen for the site of the college by the great and general court the massachusetts legislature primarily—according to cotton mather —to be near the popular and highly respected puritan preacher thomas shepard in may 1638 13 14 the name of the settlement was changed to cambridge in honor of the university in cambridge england 5 15 hooker and shepard newtowne s ministers and the college s first president major benefactor and first schoolmaster were all cambridge alumni as was the colony s governor john winthrop in 1629 winthrop had led the signing of the founding document of the city of boston which was known as the cambridge agreement after the university 16 it was governor thomas dudley who in 1650 signed the charter creating the corporation which still governs harvard college 17 18 george washington in cambridge 1775 cambridge grew slowly as an agricultural village eight miles 13 km by road from boston the capital of the colony by the american revolution most residents lived near the common and harvard college with farms and estates comprising most of the town most of the inhabitants were descendants of the original puritan colonists but there was also a small elite of anglican worthies who were not involved in village life who made their livings from estates investments and trade and lived in mansions along the road to watertown today s brattle street still known as tory row coming up from virginia george washington took command of the volunteer american soldiers camped on cambridge common on july 3 1775 5 now reckoned the birthplace of the u.s army 19 most of the tory estates were confiscated after the revolution on january 24 1776 henry knox arrived with artillery captured from fort ticonderoga which enabled washington to drive the british army out of boston a map of cambridge from 1873 between 1790 and 1840 cambridge began to grow rapidly with the construction of the west boston bridge in 1792 that connected cambridge directly to boston making it no longer necessary to travel eight miles 13 km through the boston neck roxbury and brookline to cross the charles river a second bridge the canal bridge opened in 1809 alongside the new middlesex canal the new bridges and roads made what were formerly estates and marshland into prime industrial and residential districts in the mid-19th century cambridge was the center of a literary revolution when it gave the country a new identity through poetry and literature cambridge was home to some of the famous fireside poets—so called because their poems would often be read aloud by families in front of their evening fires in their day the fireside poets — henry wadsworth longfellow james russell lowell and oliver wendell holmes —were as popular and influential as rock stars are today citation needed soon after turnpikes were built the cambridge and concord turnpike today s broadway and concord ave the middlesex turnpike hampshire st and massachusetts ave northwest of porter square and what are today s cambridge main and harvard streets were roads to connect various areas of cambridge to the bridges in addition the town was connected to the boston maine railroad 20 leading to the development of porter square as well as the creation of neighboring town somerville from the formerly rural parts of charlestown 1852 map of boston area showing cambridge and regional rail lines and highlighting the course of the middlesex canal cambridge is toward the bottom of the map and outlined in yellow and should not be confused with the pink-outlined and partially cropped west cambridge now arlington cambridge was incorporated as a city in 1846 5 this was despite noticeable tensions between east cambridge cambridgeport and old cambridge that stemmed from differences in each area s culture sources of income and the national origins of the residents 21 the city s commercial center began to shift from harvard square to central square which became the downtown of the city around this time between 1850 and 1900 cambridge took on much of its present character— streetcar suburban development along the turnpikes with working-class and industrial neighborhoods focused on east cambridge comfortable middle-class housing being built on old estates in cambridgeport and mid-cambridge and upper-class enclaves near harvard university and on the minor hills of the city the coming of the railroad to north cambridge and northwest cambridge then led to three major changes in the city the development of massive brickyards and brickworks between massachusetts ave. concord ave and alewife brook the ice-cutting industry launched by frederic tudor on fresh pond and the carving up of the last estates into residential subdivisions to provide housing to the thousands of immigrants that arrived to work in the new industries for many decades the city s largest employer was the new england glass company founded in 1818 by the middle of the 19th century it was the largest and most modern glassworks in the world in 1888 all production was moved by edward drummond libbey to toledo ohio where it continues today under the name owens illinois flint glassware with heavy lead content produced by that company is prized by antique glass collectors today there is none on public display in cambridge but there is a large collection in the toledo museum of art there are also a few pieces in the museum of fine arts boston and in the sandwich glass museum on cape cod by 1920 cambridge was one of the main industrial cities of new england with nearly 120,000 residents among the largest businesses located in cambridge during the period of industrialization was the firm of carter s ink company whose neon sign long adorned the charles river and which was for many years the largest manufacturer of ink in the world next door was the atheneum press confectionery and snack manufacturers in the cambridgeport-area 4-kendall corridor included the kennedy biscuit factory later part of nabisco and originator of the fig newton 22 necco squirrel brands 23 george close company 1861–1930s 24 daggett chocolate 1892–1960s recipes bought by necco 25 fox cross company 1920–1980 originator of the charleston chew and now part of tootsie roll industries 26 kendall confectionery company and james o welch 1927–1963 originator of junior mints sugar daddies sugar mamas and sugar babies now part of tootsie roll industries 27 in the 2010s only the cambridge brands subsidiary of tootsie roll industries remains in town still manufacturing junior mints in the old welch factory on main street 27 the blake and knowles steam pump company 1886 and the kendall boiler and tank company 1880 now in chelmsford massachusetts and the new england glass company 1818–1878 were among the industrial manufacturers in what are now the kendall square and east cambridge neighborhoods as industry in new england began to decline during the great depression and after world war ii cambridge lost much of its industrial base it also began the transition to being an intellectual rather than an industrial center harvard university had always been important in the city both as a landowner and as an institution but it began to play a more dominant role in the city s life and culture when radcliffe college was established in 1879 the town became a mecca for some of the nation s most academically talented female students also the move of the massachusetts institute of technology from boston in 1916 ensured cambridge s status as an intellectual center of the united states after the 1950s the city s population began to decline slowly as families tended to be replaced by single people and young couples the 1980s brought a wave of high-technology startups creating software such as visicalc and lotus 1-2-3 and advanced computers but many of these companies fell into decline with the fall of the minicomputer and dos based systems the city continues to be home to many startups kendall square continued to be a major software hub through the dot-com boom and today hosts offices of major technology companies including google microsoft amazon.com and akamai headquarters in 1976 harvard s plans to start experiments with recombinant dna led to a three-month moratorium and a citizen review panel in the end cambridge decided to allow such experiments but passed safety regulations in 1977 this led to regulatory certainty and acceptance when biogen opened a lab in 1982 in contrast to hostility which caused the genetic institute a harvard spinoff to abandon somerville and boston for cambridge 28 the biotech and pharmaceutical industries have since thrived in cambridge which now includes headquarters for biogen and genzyme and laboratories for novartis teva takeda alnylam ironwood catabasis moderna therapeutics editas medicine and support companies such as cytel and many smaller companies by the end of the 20th century cambridge had one of the most expensive housing markets in the northeastern united states citation needed while maintaining much diversity in class race and age it became harder and harder for those who grew up in the city to be able to afford to stay the end of rent control in 1994 prompted many cambridge renters to move to housing that was more affordable in somerville and other communities as of 2012 update cambridge s mix of
