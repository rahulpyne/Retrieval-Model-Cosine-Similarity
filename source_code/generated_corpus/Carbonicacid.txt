sometimes given to solutions of carbon dioxide in water carbonated water because such solutions contain small amounts of h 2 co 3 in physiology carbonic acid is described as volatile acid or respiratory acid because it is the only acid excreted as a gas by the lungs 2 carbonic acid which is a weak acid forms two kinds of salts the carbonates and the bicarbonates in geology carbonic acid causes limestone to dissolve producing calcium bicarbonate which leads to many limestone features such as stalactites and stalagmites the long-held belief that carbonic acid could not exist as a pure compound was disproved in 1993 by the preparation of the pure substance 3 this was independently confirmed in 2011 4 chemical equilibrium edit when carbon dioxide dissolves in water it exists in chemical equilibrium producing carbonic acid 5 co 2 h 2 o ⇌ h 2 co 3 the hydration equilibrium constant at 25 °c is called k h which in the case of carbonic acid is h 2 co 3 co 2 ≈ 1.7×10 −3 in pure water 6 and ≈ 1.2×10 −3 in seawater 7 hence the majority of the carbon dioxide is not converted into carbonic acid remaining as co 2 molecules in the absence of a catalyst the equilibrium is reached quite slowly the rate constants are 0.039 s −1 for the forward reaction co 2  h 2 o → h 2 co 3 and 23 s −1 for the reverse reaction h 2 co 3 → co 2 h 2 o carbonic acid is used in the making of soft drinks inexpensive and artificially carbonated sparkling wines and other bubbly drinks the addition of two molecules of water to co 2 would give orthocarbonic acid c oh 4 which exists only in minute amounts in aqueous solution addition of base to an excess of carbonic acid gives bicarbonate hydrogen carbonate with excess base carbonic acid reacts to give carbonate salts because carbon dioxide is non-polar it cannot dissolve in the bloodstream to travel to the lungs as such carbonic anhydrase converts carbon dioxide and water into carbonic acid which is polar and thus can travel through the body in the lungs carbonic anhydrase converts carbonic acid back into water and carbon dioxide to expel carbon dioxide through the lungs without losing water role of carbonic acid in blood edit carbonic acid is an intermediate step on the transport of co 2 out of the body via respiratory gas exchange the hydration reaction of co 2 is generally very slow in the absence of a catalyst but red blood cells contain carbonic anhydrase which both increases the reaction rate and dissociates a hydrogen ion h from the resulting carbonic acid leaving bicarbonate hco 3 − dissolved in the blood plasma this catalysed reaction is reversed in the lungs where it converts the bicarbonate back into co 2 and allows it to be expelled this equilibration plays an important role as a buffer in mammalian blood 8 a 2016 theoretical report suggests that carbonic acid may have pivotal role in protonating various nitrogen bases in blood serum 9 role of carbonic acid in ocean chemistry edit the oceans of the world have absorbed almost half of the co 2 emitted by humans from the burning of fossil fuels 10 it has been theorized that the extra dissolved carbon dioxide has caused the ocean s average surface ph to shift by about −0.1 unit from pre-industrial levels this theory is known as ocean acidification 11 acidity of carbonic acid edit carbonic acid is one of the polyprotic acids it is diprotic – it has two protons which may dissociate from the parent molecule thus there are two dissociation constants the first one for the dissociation into the bicarbonate also called hydrogen carbonate ion hco 3 − h 2 co 3 ⇌ hco 3 − h k a1 2.5×10 −4 5 p k a1 3.6 at 25 °c care must be taken when quoting and using the first dissociation constant of carbonic acid in aqueous solution carbonic acid exists in equilibrium with carbon dioxide and the concentration of h 2 co 3 is much lower than the concentration of co 2 in many analyses h 2 co 3 includes dissolved co 2 referred to as co 2 aq h 2 co 3 is used to represent the two species when writing the aqueous chemical equilibrium equation the equation may be rewritten as follows 5 h 2 co 3 ⇌ hco 3 − h k a app 4.47×10 −7 p k app 6.35 at 25 °c and ionic strength 0.0 whereas this apparent p k a is quoted as the dissociation constant of carbonic acid it is ambiguous it might better be referred to as the acidity constant of dissolved carbon dioxide as it is particularly useful for calculating the ph of co 2 containing solutions a similar situation applies to sulfurous acid h 2 so 3 which exists in equilibrium with substantial amounts of unhydrated sulfur dioxide the second constant is for the dissociation of the bicarbonate ion into the carbonate ion co 3 2− hco 3 − ⇌ co 3 2− h k a2 4.69×10 −11 p k a2 10.329 at 25 °c and ionic strength 0.0 the three acidity constants are defined as follows k a 1 h hco 3 − h 2 co 3 k a app h hco 3 − h 2 co 3 co 2 aq k a 2 h co 3 2 − hco 3 − \displaystyle k a1 \frac \text h \text hco 3

solutions edit at a given temperature the composition of a pure carbonic acid solution or of a pure co 2 solution is completely determined by the partial pressure p co 2 \displaystyle p \text co 2 of carbon dioxide above the solution to calculate this composition account must be taken of the above equilibria between the three different carbonate forms h 2 co 3 hco 3 − and co 3 2− as well as of the hydration equilibrium between dissolved co 2 and h 2 co 3 with constant k h h 2 co 3 co 2 \displaystyle \textstyle k h \frac \text h 2 \text co 3 \text co 2 see above and of the following equilibrium

1 5.71 × 10 − 0 4 3.78 × 10 − 0 4 5.61 × 10 −11 we see that in the total range of pressure the ph is always largely lower than pka 2 so that the co 3 2− concentration is always negligible with respect to hco 3 − concentration in fact co 3 2− plays no quantitative role in the present calculation see remark below for vanishing p co 2 \displaystyle p \text co 2 the ph is close to the one of pure water ph 7 and the dissolved carbon is essentially in the hco 3 − form for normal atmospheric conditions p co 2 3.5 × 10 − 4 \displaystyle p \text co 2 3.5\times 10 -4 atm we get a slightly acid solution ph 5.7 and the dissolved carbon is now essentially in the co 2 form from this pressure on oh − becomes also negligible so that the ionized part of the solution is now an equimolar mixture of h and hco 3 − for a co 2 pressure typical of the one in carbonated drink bottles p co 2 \displaystyle p \text co 2 2.5 atm we get a relatively acid medium ph 3.7 with a high concentration of dissolved co 2 these features contribute to the sour and sparkling taste of these drinks between 2.5 and 10 atm the ph crosses the pka 1 value 3.60 giving a dominant h 2 co 3 concentration with respect to hco 3 − at high pressures a plot of the equilibrium concentrations of these different forms of dissolved inorganic carbon and which species is dominant as a function of the ph of the solution is known as a bjerrum plot remark as noted above co 3 2− may be neglected for this specific problem resulting in the following very precise analytical expression for h h ≃ 10 − 14 k h k a 1 k h p co 2 1 2 \displaystyle \text h \simeq \left 10 -14 \frac k h k a1 k \text h p \text co 2 \right 1 2 spectroscopic studies of carbonic acid edit theoretical calculations show that the presence of even a single molecule of water causes carbonic acid to revert to carbon dioxide and water in the absence of water the dissociation of gaseous carbonic acid is predicted to be very slow with a half-life of 180,000 years 12 this may only apply to isolated carbonic acid molecules however as it has been predicted to catalyze its own decomposition 13 the longstanding belief was that pure carbonic acid cannot be obtained at room temperatures about 20 °c or about 70 °f due to its catalytic destruction by water 12 it has been discovered that it can be generated by exposing a frozen mixture of water and carbon dioxide to high-energy radiation and then warming to remove the excess water the carbonic acid that remains is characterized by infrared spectroscopy the fact that the carbonic acid was prepared by irradiating a solid h 2 o co 2 mixture may suggest that h 2 co 3 might be found in outer space where frozen ices of h 2 o and co 2 are common as are cosmic rays and ultraviolet light to help them react 12 the same carbonic acid polymorph denoted beta carbonic acid was prepared by heating alternating layers of glassy aqueous solutions of bicarbonate and acid in vacuum which causes protonation of bicarbonate followed by removal of the solvent the previously suggested alpha carbonic acid which was prepared by the same technique using methanol rather than water as a solvent was shown to be a monomethyl ester ch 3 ocooh 14
