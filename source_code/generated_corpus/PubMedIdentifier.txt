states national library of medicine nlm release date january 1996 access website www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed pubmed is a free search engine accessing primarily the medline database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics the united states national library of medicine nlm at the national institutes of health maintains the database as part of the entrez system of information retrieval from 1971 to 1997 medline online access to the medlars online computerized database had been primarily through institutional facilities such as university libraries pubmed first released in january 1996 ushered in the era of private free home and office-based medline searching 1 the pubmed system was offered free to the public in june 1997 when medline searches via the web were demonstrated in a ceremony by vice president al gore 2 content edit in addition to medline pubmed provides access to older references from the print version of index medicus back to 1951 and earlier references to some journals before they were indexed in index medicus and medline for instance science bmj and annals of surgery very recent entries to records for an article before it is indexed with medical subject headings mesh and added to medline and a collection of books available full-text and other subsets of nlm records 3 pmc citations many pubmed records contain links to full text articles some of which are freely available often in pubmed central 4 and local mirrors such as uk pubmed central 5 information about the journals indexed in medline and available through pubmed is found in the nlm catalog 6 as of 8 february 2015 update pubmed has over 24.6 million records going back to 1966 selectively to the year 1865 and very selectively to 1809 about 500,000 new records are added each year as of the same date update 13.1 million of pubmed s records are listed with their abstracts and 14.2 million articles have links to full-text of which 3.8 million articles are available full-text for free for any user citation needed in 2016 nlm changed the indexing system so that publishers will be able to directly correct typos and errors in pubmed indexed articles 7 characteristics edit standard searches edit simple searches on pubmed can be carried out by entering key aspects of a subject into pubmed s search window pubmed translates this initial search formulation and automatically adds field names relevant mesh medical subject headings terms synonyms boolean operators and nests the resulting terms appropriately enhancing the search formulation significantly in particular by routinely combining using the or operator textwords and mesh terms the examples given in a pubmed tutorial 8 demonstrate how this automatic process works causes sleep walking is translated as etiology subheading or etiology all fields or causes all fields or causality mesh terms or causality all fields and somnambulism mesh terms or somnambulism all fields or sleep all fields and walking all fields or sleep walking all fields likewise heart attack aspirin prevention is translated as myocardial infarction mesh terms or myocardial all fields and infarction all fields or myocardial infarction all fields or heart all fields and attack all fields or heart attack all fields and aspirin mesh terms or aspirin all fields and prevention and control subheading or prevention all fields and control all fields or prevention and control all fields or prevention all fields the new pubmed interface launched in october 2009 encourages the use of such quick google-like search formulations they have also been described as telegram searches 9 comprehensive searches edit for comprehensive optimal searches in pubmed it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of its core component medline and especially of the mesh medical subject headings controlled vocabulary used to index medline articles they may also require complex search strategies use of field names tags proper use of limits and other features and are best carried out by pubmed search specialists or librarians 10 who are able to select the right type of search and carefully adjust it for precision and recall 11 journal article parameters edit when a journal article is indexed numerous article parameters are extracted and stored as structured information such parameters are article type mesh terms e.g. clinical trial secondary identifiers mesh terms language country of the journal or publication history e-publication date print journal publication date publication type clinical queries systematic reviews edit publication type parameter enables many special features a special feature of pubmed is its clinical queries section where clinical categories systematic reviews and medical genetics subjects can be searched with study-type filters automatically applied to identify substantial robust studies 12 as these clinical girish can generate small sets of robust studies with considerable precision it has been suggested that this pubmed section can be used as a point-of-care resource 13 secondary id edit since july 2005 the medline article indexing process extracts important identifiers from the article abstract and puts those in a field called secondary identifier si the secondary identifier field is to store accession numbers to various databases of molecular sequence data gene expression or chemical compounds and clinical trial ids for clinical trials pubmed extracts trial ids for the two largest trial registries clinicaltrials.gov nct identifier and the international standard randomized controlled trial number register irctn identifier 14
