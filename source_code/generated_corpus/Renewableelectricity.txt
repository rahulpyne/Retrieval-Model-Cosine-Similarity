part of a series on renewable energy biofuel biomass geothermal hydropower solar energy tidal power wave power wind power topics by country 100 renewable energy marketing and policy trends v t e wind solar and hydroelectricity are three emerging renewable sources of energy global public support for different energy sources 2011 based on a poll by ipsos global dvisor 1 renewable energy is generally defined as energy that is collected from resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale such as sunlight wind rain tides waves and geothermal heat 2 renewable energy often provides energy in four important areas electricity generation air and water heating cooling transportation and rural off-grid energy services 3 based on ren21 s 2016 report renewables contributed 19.2 to humans global energy consumption and 23.7 to their generation of electricity in 2014 and 2015 respectively this energy consumption is divided as 8.9 coming from traditional biomass 4.2 as heat energy modern biomass geothermal and solar heat 3.9 hydro electricity and 2.2 is electricity from wind solar geothermal and biomass worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than us 286 billion in 2015 with countries like china and the united states heavily investing in wind hydro solar and biofuels 4 globally there are an estimated 7.7 million jobs associated with the renewable energy industries with solar photovoltaics being the largest renewable employer 5 renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas in contrast to other energy sources which are concentrated in a limited number of countries rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency is resulting in significant energy security climate change mitigation and economic benefits 6 the results of a recent review of the literature 7 concluded that as greenhouse gas ghg emitters begin to be held liable for damages resulting from ghg emissions resulting in climate change a high value for liability mitigation would provide powerful incentives for deployment of renewable energy technologies in international public opinion surveys there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power 8 at the national level at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 percent of energy supply national renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond 9 some places and at least two countries iceland and norway generate all their electricity using renewable energy already and many other countries have the set a goal to reach 100 renewable energy in the future for example in denmark the government decided to switch the total energy supply electricity mobility and heating cooling to 100 renewable energy by 2050 10 while many renewable energy projects are large-scale renewable technologies are also suited to rural and remote areas and developing countries where energy is often crucial in human development 11 united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity 12 as most of renewables provide electricity renewable energy deployment is often applied in conjunction with further electrification which has several benefits for example electricity can be converted to heat without losses and even reach higher temperatures than fossil fuels can be converted into mechanical energy with high efficiency and is clean at the point of consumpion 13 14 in addition to that electrification with renewable energy is much more efficient and therefore leads to a significant reduction in primary energy requirements because most renewables don t have a steam cycle with high losses fossil power plants usually have losses of 40 to 65 15 overview see also outline of solar energy lists of renewable energy topics and sustainable energy world energy consumption by source renewables accounted for 19 in 2012 planetsolar the world s largest solar-powered boat and the first ever solar electric vehicle to circumnavigate the globe in 2012 renewable energy flows involve natural phenomena such as sunlight wind tides plant growth and geothermal heat as the international energy agency explains 16 renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly in its various forms it derives directly from the sun or from heat generated deep within the earth included in the definition is electricity and heat generated from solar wind ocean hydropower biomass geothermal resources and biofuels and hydrogen derived from renewable resources renewable energy resources and significant opportunities for energy efficiency exist over wide geographical areas in contrast to other energy sources which are concentrated in a limited number of countries rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency and technological diversification of energy sources would result in significant energy security and economic benefits 6 it would also reduce environmental pollution such as air pollution caused by burning of fossil fuels and improve public health reduce premature mortalities due to pollution and save associated health costs that amount to several hundred billion dollars annually only in the united states 17 renewable energy sources that derive their energy from the sun either directly or indirectly such as hydro and wind are expected to be capable of supplying humanity energy for almost another 1 billion years at which point the predicted increase in heat from the sun is expected to make the surface of the earth too hot for liquid water to exist 18 19 climate change and global warming concerns coupled with high oil prices peak oil and increasing government support are driving increasing renewable energy legislation incentives and commercialization 8 new government spending regulation and policies helped the industry weather the global financial crisis better than many other sectors 20 according to a 2011 projection by the international energy agency solar power generators may produce most of the world s electricity within 50 years reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment 21 as of 2011 small solar pv systems provide electricity to a few million households and micro-hydro configured into mini-grids serves many more over 44 million households use biogas made in household-scale digesters for lighting and or cooking and more than 166 million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves 22 united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity 12 at the national level at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 of energy supply national renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond and some 120 countries have various policy targets for longer-term shares of renewable energy including a 20 target of all electricity generated for the european union by 2020 some countries have much higher long-term policy targets of up to 100 renewables outside europe a diverse group of 20 or more other countries target renewable energy shares in the 2020–2030 time frame that range from 10 to 50 9 renewable energy often displaces conventional fuels in four areas electricity generation hot water space heating transportation and rural off-grid energy services 3 power generation renewables account for 28.9 of the world’s power generating capacity enough to supply 23.7 of global electricity hydroelectric energy provides 16.6 of global electricity while the remaining 7.1 comes from wind geothermal solar pv bio-power concentrated solar power csp and ocean by 2040 renewable energy is projected to equal coal and natural gas electricity generation several jurisdictions including denmark germany the state of south australia and some us states have achieved high integration of variable renewables for example in 2015 wind power met 42 of electricity demand in denmark 23.2 in portugal and 15.5 in uruguay interconnectors enable countries to balance electricity systems by allowing the import and export of renewable energy innovative hybrid systems have emerged between countries and regions 23 heating solar water heating makes an important contribution to renewable heat in many countries most notably in china which now has 70 of the global total 180 gwth most of these systems are installed on multi-family apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated 50–60 million households in china worldwide total installed solar water heating systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households the use of biomass for heating continues to grow as well in sweden national use of biomass energy has surpassed that of oil direct geothermal for heating is also growing rapidly 24 the newest addition to heating is from geothermal heat pumps which provide both heating and cooling and also flatten the electric demand curve and are thus an increasing national priority 25 26 see also renewable thermal energy transportation a bus fueled by biodiesel bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermentation mostly from carbohydrates produced in sugar or starch crops such as corn sugarcane or sweet sorghum cellulosic biomass derived from non-food sources such as trees and grasses is also being developed as a feedstock for ethanol production ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions bioethanol is widely used in the usa and in brazil biodiesel can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form but it is usually used as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in europe a solar vehicle is an electric vehicle powered completely or significantly by direct solar energy usually photovoltaic pv cells contained in solar panels convert the sun s energy directly into electric energy the term solar vehicle usually implies that solar energy is used to power all or part of a vehicle s propulsion solar power may be also used to provide power for communications or controls or other auxiliary functions solar vehicles are not sold as practical day-to-day transportation devices at present but are primarily demonstration vehicles and engineering exercises often sponsored by government agencies however indirectly solar-charged vehicles are widespread and solar boats are available commercially history prior to the development of coal in the mid 19th century nearly all energy used was renewable almost without a doubt the oldest known use of renewable energy in the form of traditional biomass to fuel fires dates from 790,000 years ago use of biomass for fire did not become commonplace until many hundreds of thousands of years later sometime between 200,000 and 400,000 years ago 27 probably the second oldest usage of renewable energy is harnessing the wind in order to drive ships over water this practice can be traced back some 7000 years to ships on the nile 28 moving into the time of recorded history the primary sources of traditional renewable energy were human labor animal power water power wind in grain crushing windmills and firewood a traditional biomass a graph of energy use in the united states up until 1900 shows oil and natural gas with about the same importance in 1900 as wind and solar played in 2010 in the 1860s and 70s there were already fears that civilization would run out of fossil fuels and the need was felt for a better source in 1873 professor augustine mouchot wrote the time will arrive when the industry of europe will cease to find those natural resources so necessary for it petroleum springs and coal mines are not inexhaustible but are rapidly diminishing in many places will man then return to the power of water and wind or will he emigrate where the most powerful source of heat sends its rays to all history will show what will come 29 in 1885 werner von siemens commenting on the discovery of the photovoltaic effect in the solid state wrote in conclusion i would say that however great the scientific importance of this discovery may be its practical value will be no less obvious when we reflect that the supply of solar energy is both without limit and without cost and that it will continue to pour down upon us for countless ages after all the coal deposits of the earth have been exhausted and forgotten 30 max weber mentioned the end of fossil fuel in the concluding paragraphs of his die protestantische ethik und der geist des kapitalismus published in 1905 31 development of solar engines continued until the outbreak of world war i the importance of solar energy was recognized in a 1911 scientific american article in the far distant future natural fuels having been exhausted solar power will remain as the only means of existence of the human race 32 the theory of peak oil was published in 1956 33 in the 1970s environmentalists promoted the development of renewable energy both as a replacement for the eventual depletion of oil as well as for an escape from dependence on oil and the first electricity generating wind turbines appeared solar had long been used for heating and cooling but solar panels were too costly to build solar farms until 1980 34 the iea 2014 world energy outlook projects a growth of renewable energy supply from 1,700 gigawatts in 2014 to 4,550 gigawatts in 2040 fossil fuels received about 550 billion in subsidies in 2013 compared to 120 billion for all renewable energies 35 mainstream technologies wind power main article wind power the 845 mw shepherds flat wind farm near arlington oregon usa airflows can be used to run wind turbines modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600 kw to 5 mw of rated power although turbines with rated output of 1.5–3 mw have become the most common for commercial use the power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed so as wind speed increases power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine 36 areas where winds are stronger and more constant such as offshore and high altitude sites are preferred locations for wind farms typically full load hours of wind turbines vary between 16 and 57 percent annually but might be higher in particularly favorable offshore sites 37 globally the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production or 40 times current electricity demand assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome this would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas particularly in areas of higher wind resources such as offshore as offshore wind speeds average 90 greater than that of land so offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land stationed turbines 38 in 2014 global wind generation was 706 terawatt-hours or 3 of the worlds total electricity 39 hydropower main articles hydroelectricity and hydropower the three gorges dam on the yangtze river in china in 2015 hydropower generated 16.6 of the worlds total electricity and 70 of all renewable electricity 40 since water is about 800 times denser than air even a slow flowing stream of water or moderate sea swell can yield considerable amounts of energy there are many forms of water energy historically hydroelectric power came from constructing large hydroelectric dams and reservoirs which are still popular in third world countries the largest of which is the three gorges dam 2003 in china and the itaipu dam 1984 built by brazil and paraguay small hydro systems are hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to 50 mw of power they are often used on small rivers or as a low impact development on larger rivers china is the largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world and has more than 45,000 small hydro installations 41 run-of-the-river hydroelectricity plants derive kinetic energy from rivers without the creation of a large reservoir this style of generation may still produce a large amount of electricity such as the chief joseph dam on the columbia river in the united states hydropower is produced in 150 countries with the asia-pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010 for counties having the largest percentage of electricity from renewables the top 50 are primarily hydroelectric china is the largest hydroelectricity producer with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010 representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use there are now three hydroelectricity stations larger than 10 gw the three gorges dam in china itaipu dam across the brazil paraguay border and guri dam in venezuela 42 wave power which captures the energy of ocean surface waves and tidal power converting the energy of tides are two forms of hydropower with future potential however they are not yet widely employed commercially a demonstration project operated by the ocean renewable power company on the coast of maine and connected to the grid harnesses tidal power from the bay of fundy location of world s highest tidal flow ocean thermal energy conversion which uses the temperature difference between cooler deep and warmer surface waters has currently no economic feasibility solar energy main article solar energy satellite image of the 550-megawatt topaz solar farm in california usa solar energy radiant light and heat from the sun is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating photovoltaics concentrated solar power csp concentrator photovoltaics cpv solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis 43 44 solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture convert and distribute solar energy passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the sun selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties and designing spaces that naturally circulate air active solar technologies encompass solar thermal energy using solar collectors for heating and solar power converting sunlight into electricity either directly using photovoltaics pv or indirectly using concentrated solar power csp a photovoltaic system converts light into electrical direct current dc by taking advantage of the photoelectric effect 45 solar pv has turned into a multi-billion fast-growing industry continues to improve its cost-effectiveness and has the most potential of any renewable technologies together with csp 46 47 concentrated solar power csp systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s csp-stirling has by far the highest efficiency among all solar energy technologies in 2011 the international energy agency said that the development of affordable inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits it will increase countries energy security through reliance on an indigenous inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource enhance sustainability reduce pollution lower the costs of mitigating climate change and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise these advantages are global hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared 43 in 2014 global solar generation was 186 terawatt-hours slightly less than 1 of the worlds total grid electricity 39 geothermal energy main articles geothermal energy geothermal electricity and renewable thermal energy steam rising from the nesjavellir geothermal power station in iceland high temperature geothermal energy is from thermal energy generated and stored in the earth thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter earth s geothermal energy originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of minerals in currently uncertain 48 but possibly roughly equal 49 proportions the geothermal gradient which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface the adjective geothermal originates from the greek roots geo meaning earth and thermos meaning heat the heat that is used for geothermal energy can be from deep within the earth all the way down to earth s core – 4,000 miles 6,400 km down at the core temperatures may reach over 9,000 °f 5,000 °c heat conducts from the core to surrounding rock extremely high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt which is commonly known as magma magma convects upward since it is lighter than the solid rock this magma then heats rock and water in the crust sometimes up to 700 °f 371 °c 50 from hot springs geothermal energy has been used for bathing since paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient roman times but it is now better known for electricity generation citation needed low temperature geothermal 25 refers to the use of the outer crust of the earth as a thermal battery to facilitate renewable thermal energy for heating and cooling buildings and other refrigeration and industrial uses in this form of geothermal a geothermal heat pump and ground-coupled heat exchanger are used together to move heat energy into the earth for cooling and out of the earth for heating on a varying seasonal basis low temperature geothermal generally referred to as ghp is an increasingly important renewable technology because it both reduces total annual energy loads associated with heating and cooling and it also flattens the electric demand curve eliminating the extreme summer and winter peak electric supply requirements thus low temperature geothermal ghp is becoming an increasing national priority with multiple tax credit support 51 and focus as part of the ongoing movement toward net zero energy 52 53 new york city has even just passed a law 54 to require ghp anytime is shown to be economical with 20 year financing including the socialized cost of carbon 55 56 bio energy main articles biomass biogas and biofuel sugarcane plantation to produce ethanol in brazil a chp power station using wood to supply 30,000 households in france biomass is biological material derived from living or recently living organisms it most often refers to plants or plant-derived materials which are specifically called lignocellulosic biomass 57 as an energy source biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into thermal chemical and biochemical methods wood remains the largest biomass energy source today 58 examples include forest residues – such as dead trees branches and tree stumps – yard clippings wood chips and even municipal solid waste in the second sense biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial chemicals including biofuels industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants including miscanthus switchgrass hemp corn poplar willow sorghum sugarcane bamboo 59 and a variety of tree species ranging from eucalyptus to oil palm palm oil plant energy is produced by crops specifically grown for use as fuel that offer high biomass output per hectare with low input energy some examples of these plants are wheat which typically yield 7.5–8 tonnes of grain per hectare and straw which typically yield 3.5–5 tonnes per hectare in the uk 60 the grain can be used for liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity plant biomass can also be degraded from cellulose to glucose through a series of chemical treatments and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first generation biofuel biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy like methane gas or transportation fuels like ethanol and biodiesel rotting garbage and agricultural and human waste all release methane gas – also called landfill gas or biogas crops such as corn and sugarcane can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel ethanol biodiesel another transportation fuel can be produced from left-over food products like vegetable oils and animal fats 61 also biomass to liquids btls and cellulosic ethanol are still under research 62 63 there is a great deal of research involving algal fuel or algae-derived biomass due to the fact that it s a non-food resource and can be produced at rates 5 to 10 times those of other types of land-based agriculture such as corn and soy once harvested it can be fermented to produce biofuels such as ethanol butanol and methane as well as biodiesel and hydrogen the biomass used for electricity generation varies by region forest by-products such as wood residues are common in the united states agricultural waste is common in mauritius sugar cane residue and southeast asia rice husks animal husbandry residues such as poultry litter are common in the united kingdom 64 biofuels include a wide range of fuels which are derived from biomass the term covers solid liquid and gaseous fuels 65 liquid biofuels include bioalcohols such as bioethanol and oils such as biodiesel gaseous biofuels include biogas landfill gas and synthetic gas bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermenting the sugar components of plant materials and it is made mostly from sugar and starch crops these include maize sugarcane and more recently sweet sorghum the latter crop is particularly suitable for growing in dryland conditions and is being investigated by international crops research institute for the semi-arid tropics for its potential to provide fuel along with food and animal feed in arid parts of asia and africa 66 with advanced technology being developed cellulosic biomass such as trees and grasses are also used as feedstocks for ethanol production ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions bioethanol is widely used in the united states and in brazil the energy costs for producing bio-ethanol are almost equal to the energy yields from bio-ethanol however according to the european environment agency biofuels do not address global warming concerns 67 biodiesel is made from vegetable oils animal fats or recycled greases it can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form or more commonly as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in europe biofuels provided 2.7 of the world s transport fuel in 2010 68 biomass biogas and biofuels are burned to produce heat power and in doing so harm the environment pollutants such as sulphurous oxides so x nitrous oxides no x and particulate matter pm are produced from the combustion of biomass the world health organisation estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution 69 biomass combustion is a major contributor 69 70 71 the life cycle of the plants is sustainable the lives of people less so energy storage main articles energy storage and grid energy storage energy storage is a collection of methods used to store electrical energy on an electrical power grid or off it electrical energy is stored during times when production especially from intermittent power plants such as renewable electricity sources such as wind power tidal power solar power exceeds consumption and returned to the grid when production falls below consumption water pumped into a hydroelectric dam is the largest form of power storage market and industry trends main article renewable energy commercialization growth of renewables global growth of renewables through to 2011 72 from the end of 2004 worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60 annually for many technologies for wind power and many other renewable technologies growth accelerated in 2009 relative to the previous four years 3 more wind power capacity was added during 2009 than any other renewable technology however grid-connected pv increased the fastest of all renewables technologies with a 60 annual average growth rate 3 in 2010 renewable power constituted about a third of the newly built power generation capacities 73 projections vary but scientists have advanced a plan to power 100 of the world s energy with wind hydroelectric and solar power by the year 2030 74 75 according to a 2011 projection by the international energy agency solar power generators may produce most of the world s electricity within 50 years reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment cedric philibert senior analyst in the renewable energy division at the iea said photovoltaic and solar-thermal plants may meet most of the world s demand for electricity by 2060 – and half of all energy needs – with wind hydropower and biomass plants supplying much of the remaining generation photovoltaic and concentrated solar power together can become the major source of electricity philibert said 21 in 2014 global wind power capacity expanded 16 to 369,553 mw 76 yearly wind energy production is also growing rapidly and has reached around 4 of worldwide electricity usage 77 11.4 in the eu 78 and it is widely used in asia and the united states in 2015 worldwide installed photovoltaics capacity increased to 227 gigawatts gw sufficient to supply 1 percent of global electricity demands 79 solar thermal energy stations operate in the usa and spain and as of 2016 the largest of these is the 392

technologies are getting cheaper through technological change and through the benefits of mass production and market competition a 2011 iea report said a portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support and added that cost reductions in critical technologies such as wind and solar are set to continue 90 hydro-electricity and geothermal electricity produced at favourable sites are now the cheapest way to generate electricity renewable energy costs continue to drop and the levelised cost of electricity lcoe is declining for wind power solar photovoltaic pv concentrated solar power csp and some biomass technologies 91 renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid-connected capacity in areas with good resources as the cost of renewable power falls the scope of economically viable applications increases renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity where oil-fired generation is the predominant power generation source e.g on islands off-grid and in some countries a lower-cost renewable solution almost always exists today 91 a series of studies by the us national renewable energy laboratory modeled the grid in the western us under a number of different scenarios where intermittent renewables accounted for 33 percent of the total power in the models inefficiencies in cycling the fossil fuel plants to compensate for the variation in solar and wind energy resulted in an additional cost of between 0.47 and 1.28 to each megawatt hour generated however the savings in the cost of the fuels saved adds up to 7 billion meaning the added costs are at most two percent of the savings 92 hydroelectricity see also list of largest hydroelectric power stations only 25 of the worlds estimated hydroelectric potential of 14,000 twh year has been

power facility being the most recent in developing countries three world bank projects for integrated solar thermal combined-cycle gas-turbine power plants in egypt mexico and morocco have been approved 104 photovoltaic development main articles growth of photovoltaics and solar power by country 50,000 100,000 150,000 200,000 2006 2010 2014 europe asia-pacific americas china middle east and africa worldwide growth of pv capacity grouped by region in mw 2006–2014 photovoltaics pv uses solar cells assembled into solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity it s a fast-growing technology doubling its worldwide installed capacity every couple of years pv systems range from small residential and commercial rooftop or building integrated installations to large utility-scale photovoltaic power station the predominant pv technology is crystalline silicon while thin-film solar cell technology accounts for about 10 percent of global photovoltaic deployment in recent years pv technology has improved its electricity generating efficiency reduced the installation cost per watt as well as its energy payback time and has reached grid parity in at least 30 different markets by 2014 105 financial institutions are predicting a second solar gold rush in the near future 106 107 108 at the end of 2014 worldwide pv capacity reached at least 177,000 megawatts photovoltaics grew fastest in china followed by japan and the united states while germany remains the world s largest overall producer of photovoltaic power contributing about 7.0 percent to the overall electricity generation italy meets 7.9 percent of its electricity demands with photovoltaic power—the highest share worldwide 109 for 2015 global cumulative capacity is forecasted to increase by more than 50 gigawatts gw by 2018 worldwide capacity is projected to reach as much as 430 gigawatts this corresponds to a tripling within five years 110 solar power is forecasted to become the world s largest source of electricity by 2050 with solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power contributing 16 and 11 respectively this requires an increase of installed pv capacity to 4,600 gw of which more than half is expected to be deployed in china and india 111 photovoltaic power stations main article list of photovoltaic power stations solar panels at the 550 mw topaz solar farm nellis solar power plant photovoltaic power plant in nevada usa commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s as the cost of solar electricity has fallen the number of grid-connected solar pv systems has grown into the millions and utility-scale solar power stations with hundreds of megawatts are being built solar pv is rapidly becoming an inexpensive low-carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the sun many solar photovoltaic power stations have been built mainly in europe china and the usa 112 the 579 mw solar star in the united states is the world s largest pv power station many of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use tracking systems that follow the sun s daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than fixed-mounted systems there are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations however when it comes to renewable energy systems and pv it is not just large systems that matter building-integrated photovoltaics or onsite pv systems use existing land and structures and generate power close to where it is consumed 113 biofuel development see also ethanol fuel sustainable biofuel and issues relating to biofuels brazil produces bioethanol made from sugarcane available throughout the country a typical gas station with dual fuel service is marked a for alcohol ethanol and g for gasoline biofuels provided 3 of the world s transport fuel in 2010 68 mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries at the national level and in 29 states provinces 68 according to the international energy agency biofuels have the potential to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050 114 since the 1970s brazil has had an ethanol fuel program which has allowed the country to become the world s second largest producer of ethanol after the united states and the world s largest exporter 115 brazil s ethanol fuel program uses modern equipment and cheap sugarcane as feedstock and the residual cane-waste bagasse is used to produce heat and power 116 there are no longer light vehicles in brazil running on pure gasoline by the end of 2008 there were 35,000 filling stations throughout brazil with at least one ethanol pump 117 unfortunately operation car wash has seriously eroded public trust in oil companies and has implicated several high ranking brazilian officials nearly all the gasoline sold in the united states today is mixed with 10 ethanol 118 and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends ford daimler ag and gm are among the automobile companies that sell flexible-fuel cars trucks and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85 ethanol by mid-2006 there were approximately 6 million ethanol compatible vehicles on u.s roads 119 geothermal development see also geothermal energy in the united states geothermal plant at the geysers california usa geothermal power is cost effective reliable sustainable and environmentally friendly 120 but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries recent technological advances have expanded the range and size of viable resources especially for applications such as home heating opening a potential for widespread exploitation geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels as a result geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels the international geothermal association iga has reported that 10,715 mw of geothermal power in 24 countries is online which is expected to generate 67,246 gwh of electricity in 2010 121 this represents a 20 increase in geothermal power online capacity since 2005 iga projects this will grow to 18,500 mw by 2015 due to the large number of projects presently under consideration often in areas previously assumed to have little exploitable resource 121 in 2010 the united states led the world in geothermal electricity production with 3,086 mw of installed capacity from 77 power plants 122 the largest group of geothermal power plants in the world is located at the geysers a geothermal field in california 123 the philippines follows the us as the second highest producer of geothermal power in the world with 1,904 mw of capacity online geothermal power makes up approximately 18 of the country s electricity generation 122 developing countries main article renewable energy in developing countries solar cookers use sunlight as energy source for outdoor cooking renewable energy technology has sometimes been seen as a costly luxury item by critics and affordable only in the affluent developed world this erroneous view has persisted for many years but 2015 was the first year when investment in non-hydro renewables was higher in developing countries with 156 billion invested mainly in china india and brazil 124 renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries in rural and remote areas transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative 125 technology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power the approximately 1.3 billion people around the world who don t have access to grid electricity even though they are typically very poor these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene 126 as of 2010 an estimated 3 million households get power from small solar pv systems 127 kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita more than 30,000 very small solar panels each producing 12 to 30 watts are sold in kenya annually some small island developing states sids are also turning to solar power to reduce their costs and increase their sustainability 128 micro-hydro configured into mini-grids also provide power over 44 million households use biogas made in household-scale digesters for lighting and or cooking and more than 166 million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves 22 clean liquid fuel sourced from renewable feedstocks are used for cooking and lighting in energy-poor areas of the developing world alcohol fuels ethanol and methanol can be produced sustainably from non-food sugary starchy and cellulostic feedstocks project gaia inc and cleanstar mozambique are implementing clean cooking programs with liquid ethanol stoves in ethiopia kenya nigeria and mozambique 129 renewable energy projects in many developing countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to poverty reduction by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking space heating and lighting renewable energy can also contribute to education by providing electricity to schools 130 industry and policy trends see also renewable energy commercialization global new investments in renewable energy 131 u.s president barack obama s american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 includes more than 70 billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs leading renewable energy companies include first solar gamesa ge energy hanwha q cells sharp solar siemens sunopta suntech power and vestas 132 many national state and local governments have also created green banks a green bank is a quasi-public financial institution that uses public capital to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies 133 green banks use a variety of financial tools to bridge market gaps that hinder the deployment of clean energy the military has also focused on the use of renewable fuels for military vehicles unlike fossil fuels renewable fuels can be produced in any country creating a strategic advantage the us military has already committed itself to have 50 of its energy consumption come from alternative sources 134 the international renewable energy agency irena is an intergovernmental organization for promoting the adoption of renewable energy worldwide it aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate capacity building and technology transfer irena was formed on 26 january 2009 by 75 countries signing the charter of irena 135 as of march 2010 irena has 143 member states who all are considered as founding members of which 14 have also ratified the statute 136 as of 2011 119 countries have some form of national renewable energy policy target or renewable support policy national targets now exist in at least 98 countries there is also a wide range of policies at state provincial and local levels 68 united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity 12 in october 2011 he announced the creation of a high-level group to drum up support for energy access energy efficiency and greater use of renewable energy the group is to be co-chaired by kandeh yumkella the chair of un energy and director general of the un industrial development organisation and charles holliday chairman of bank of america 137 100 renewable energy main article 100 renewable energy the incentive to use 100 renewable energy for electricity transport or even total primary energy supply globally has been motivated by global warming and other ecological as well as economic concerns the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated 138 at the national level at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 of energy supply also professors s pacala and robert h socolow have developed a series of stabilization wedges that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change and renewable energy sources in aggregate constitute the largest number of their wedges 139 using 100 renewable energy was first suggested in a science paper published in 1975 by danish physicist bent sørensen 140 it was followed by several other proposals until in 1998 the first detailed analysis of scenarios with very high shares of renewables were published these were followed by the first detailed 100 scenarios in 2006 a phd thesis was published by czisch in which it was shown that in a 100 renewable scenario energy supply could match demand in every hour of the year in europa and north africa in the same year danish energy professor henrik lund published a first paper 141 in which he addresses the optimal combination of renewables which was followed by several other papers on the transition to 100 renewable energy in denmark since then lund has been publishing several papers on 100 renewable energy after 2009 publications began to rise steeply covering 100 scenarios for countries in europa america australia and other parts of the world 142 in 2011 mark z jacobson professor of civil and environmental engineering at stanford university and mark delucchi published a study on 100 renewable global energy supply in the journal energy policy they found producing all new energy with wind power solar power and hydropower by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050 barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be primarily social and political not technological or economic they also found that energy costs with a wind solar water system should be similar to today s energy costs 143 similarly in the united states the independent national research council has noted that sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change energy security and the escalation of energy costs … renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the united states taken collectively can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand 144 the most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political and not technological according to the 2013 post carbon pathways report which reviewed many international studies the key roadblocks are climate change denial the fossil fuels lobby political inaction unsustainable energy consumption outdated energy infrastructure and financial constraints 145 emerging technologies other renewable energy technologies are still under development and include cellulosic ethanol hot-dry-rock geothermal power and marine energy 146 these technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies but still depend on attracting sufficient attention and research development and demonstration rd d funding 146 there are numerous organizations within the academic federal and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy this research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields 147 multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on renewable energy in recent years two of the most prominent of these labs are sandia national laboratories and the national renewable energy laboratory nrel both of which are funded by the united states department of energy and supported by various corporate partners 148 sandia has a total budget of 2.4 billion 149 while nrel has a budget of 375 million 150 enhanced geothermal system enhanced geothermal system see file description for details enhanced geothermal systems egs are a new type of geothermal power technologies that do not require natural convective hydrothermal resources the vast majority of geothermal energy within drilling reach is in dry and non-porous rock 151 egs technologies enhance and or create geothermal resources in this hot dry rock hdr through hydraulic stimulation egs and hdr technologies like hydrothermal geothermal are expected to be baseload resources which produce power 24 hours a day like a fossil plant distinct from hydrothermal hdr and egs may be feasible anywhere in the world depending on the economic limits of drill depth good locations are over deep granite covered by a thick 3–5 km layer of insulating sediments which slow heat loss 152 there are hdr and egs systems currently being developed and tested in france australia japan germany the u.s and switzerland the largest egs project in the world is a 25 megawatt demonstration plant currently being developed in the cooper basin australia the cooper basin has the potential to generate 5,000–10,000 mw cellulosic ethanol several refineries that can process biomass and turn it into ethanol are built by companies such as iogen poet and abengoa while other companies such as the verenium corporation novozymes and dyadic international 153 are producing enzymes which could enable future commercialization the shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players from farmers to biotechnology firms and from project developers to investors 154 marine energy rance tidal power station france marine energy also sometimes referred to as ocean energy refers to the energy carried by ocean waves tides salinity and ocean temperature differences the movement of water in the world s oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy or energy in motion this energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes transport and industries the term marine energy encompasses both wave power – power from surface waves and tidal power – obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water reverse electrodialysis red is a technology for generating electricity by mixing fresh river water and salty sea water in large power cells designed for this purpose as of 2016 it is being tested at a small scale 50 kw offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy as wind power is derived from the wind even if the wind turbines are placed over water the oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world 155 station country location capacity refs 1 sihwa lake tidal power station south korea 37°18′47″n 126°36′46″e ﻿ ﻿ 37.31306°n 126.61278°e ﻿ 37.31306 126.61278 ﻿ sihwa

systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for the purpose of electricity generation thermoelectric or thermovoltaic devices convert a temperature difference between dissimilar materials into an electric current floating solar arrays floating solar arrays are pv systems that float on the surface of drinking water reservoirs quarry lakes irrigation canals or remediation and tailing ponds a small number of such systems exist in france india japan south korea the united kingdom singapore and the united states 158 159 160 161 162 the systems are said to have advantages over photovoltaics on land the cost of land is more expensive and there are fewer rules and regulations for structures built on bodies of water not used for recreation unlike most land-based solar plants floating arrays can be unobtrusive because they are hidden from public view they achieve higher efficiencies than pv panels on land because water cools the panels the panels have a special coating to prevent rust or corrosion 163 in may 2008 the far niente winery in oakville california pioneered the world s first floatovoltaic system by installing 994 solar pv modules with a total capacity of 477 kw onto 130 pontoons and floating them on the winery s irrigation pond 164 utility-scale floating pv farms are starting to be built kyocera will develop the world s largest a 13.4 mw farm on the reservoir above yamakura dam in chiba prefecture 165 using 50,000 solar panels 166 167 salt-water resistant floating farms are also being constructed for ocean use 168 the largest so far announced floatovoltaic project is a 350 mw power station in the amazon region of brazil 169 solar-assisted heat pump a heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a heat sink heat pumps are designed to move thermal energy opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one a solar-assisted heat pump represents the integration of a heat pump and thermal solar panels in a single integrated system typically these two technologies are used separately or only placing them in parallel to produce hot water 170 in this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pump s evaporator 171 the goal of this system is to get high cop and then produce energy in a more efficient and less expensive way it is possible to use any type of solar thermal panel sheet and tubes roll-bond heat pipe thermal plates or hybrid mono polycrystalline thin film in combination with the heat pump the use of a hybrid panel is preferable because it allows to cover a part of the electricity demand of the heat pump and reduce the power consumption and consequently the variable costs of the system artificial photosynthesis artificial photosynthesis uses techniques including nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds by splitting water to produce hydrogen and then using carbon dioxide to make methanol 172 researchers in this field are striving to design molecular mimics of photosynthesis that utilize a wider region of the solar spectrum employ catalytic systems made from abundant inexpensive materials that are robust readily repaired non-toxic stable in a variety of environmental conditions and perform more efficiently allowing a greater proportion of photon energy to end up in the storage compounds i.e. carbohydrates rather than building and sustaining living cells 173 however prominent research faces hurdles sun catalytix a mit spin-off stopped scaling up their prototype fuel-cell in 2012 because it offers few savings over other ways to make hydrogen from sunlight 174 algae fuels producing liquid fuels from oil-rich varieties of algae is an ongoing research topic various microalgae grown in open or closed systems are being tried including some system that can be set up in brownfield and desert lands solar aircraft in 2016 solar impulse 2 was the first solar-powered aircraft to complete circumnavigation of the world an electric aircraft is an aircraft that runs on electric motors rather than internal combustion engines with electricity coming from fuel cells solar cells ultracapacitors power beaming 175 or batteries currently flying manned electric aircraft are mostly experimental demonstrators though many small unmanned aerial vehicles are powered by batteries electrically powered model aircraft have been flown since the 1970s with one report in 1957 176 177 the first man-carrying electrically powered flights were made in 1973 178 between 2015-2016 a manned solar-powered plane solar impulse 2 completed a circumnavigation of the earth 179 solar updraft tower the solar updraft tower is a renewable-energy power plant for generating electricity from low temperature solar heat sunshine heats the air beneath a very wide greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall chimney tower the resulting convection causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the chimney effect this airflow drives wind turbines placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce electricity plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation and may allow development of other applications such as water extraction or distillation and agriculture or horticulture a more advanced version of a similarly themed technology is the vortex engine which aims to replace large physical chimneys with a vortex of air created by a shorter less-expensive structure space-based solar power for either photovoltaic or thermal systems one option is to loft them into space particularly geosynchronous orbit to be competitive with earth-based solar power systems the specific mass kg kw times the cost to loft mass plus the cost of the parts needs to be 2400 or less i.e. for a parts cost plus rectenna of 1100 kw the product of the kg and kg kw must be 1300 kw or less 180 thus for 6.5 kg kw the transport cost cannot exceed 200 kg while that will require a 100 to one reduction spacex is targeting a ten to one reduction reaction engines may make a 100 to one reduction possible carbon-neutral and negative fuels main articles carbon-neutral fuel and methanol economy carbon-neutral fuels are synthetic fuels including methane gasoline diesel fuel jet fuel or ammonia 181 produced by hydrogenating waste carbon dioxide recycled from power plant flue-gas emissions recovered from automotive exhaust gas or derived from carbonic acid in seawater 182 such fuels are considered carbon-neutral because they do not result in a net increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases 183 t carbon-neutral fuels offer relatively low cost energy storage alleviating the problems of wind and solar variability and they enable distribution of wind water and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines 184 nighttime wind power is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel because the load curve for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day so the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative 184 germany has built a 250 kilowatt synthetic methane plant which they are scaling up to 10 megawatts 185 186 187 the george olah carbon dioxide recycling plant in grindavík iceland has been producing 2 million liters of methanol transportation fuel per year from flue exhaust of the svartsengi power station since 2011 188 it has the capacity to produce 5 million liters per year 189 debate main articles renewable energy debate nuclear power proposed as renewable energy and green job renewable electricity production from sources such as wind power and solar power is sometimes criticized for being variable or intermittent but is not true for concentrated solar geothermal and biofuels that have continuity in any case the international energy agency has stated that deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and through local generation contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks 190 there have been not in my back yard nimby concerns relating to the visual and other impacts of some wind farms with local residents sometimes fighting or blocking construction 191 in the usa the massachusetts cape wind project was delayed for years partly because of aesthetic concerns however residents in other areas have been more positive according to a town councilor the overwhelming majority of locals believe that the ardrossan wind farm in scotland has enhanced the area 192 a recent uk government document states that projects are generally more likely to succeed if they have broad public support and the consent of local communities this means giving communities both a say and a stake 193 in countries such as germany and denmark many renewable projects are owned by communities particularly through cooperative structures and contribute significantly to overall levels of renewable energy deployment 194 195 the market for renewable energy technologies has continued to grow climate change concerns and increasing in green jobs coupled with high oil prices peak oil oil wars oil spills promotion of electric vehicles and renewable electricity nuclear disasters and increasing government support are driving increasing renewable energy legislation incentives and commercialization 8 new government spending regulation and policies helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis
