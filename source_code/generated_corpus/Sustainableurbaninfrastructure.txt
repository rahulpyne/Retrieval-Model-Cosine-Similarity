signposts bollards and street furniture are prone to impact from vehicles and damage resulting in ever increasing costs associated with maintenance we are in the midst of global infrastructure crisis infrastructure worldwide is deteriorating and needs to be replaced or enhanced existing public funding sources are inadequate to meet the need but the problem is more than money — what we believe is required is a broad robust infrastructure life cycle perspective deloitte research closing the infrastructure gap washington d.c. deloitte research new self-healing technology protects surrounding paving and foundations from damage when items of infrastructure are impacted reducing maintenance and improving the sustainability of urban developments self-healing developments result in zero waste and zero landfill from maintenance on items of urban infrastructure for the life of the development according to the united states environmental protection agency the planning process of sustainable design can lead to the development of a community that is ecologically economically and socially sustainable 6 the design emphasis for a sustainable urban infrastructure is on localization and sustainable living the aim is to reduce individual s ecological footprint according to the principles of sustainable development in areas with a high population density the criteria for what can be included in this kind of urban environment varies from place to place given differences in existing infrastructure and built form climate and availability of local resources or talents generally speaking the following could be considered sustainable urban infrastructure public transport networks distributed generation and integrated energy demand management initiatives and programs high efficiency buildings and other development constraints such as only permitting the construction of green buildings and sustainable habitats with energy-efficient landscaping connected green spaces and wildlife corridors low impact development practices to protect water resources federation of canadian municipalities edit several organizations in canada related to the fcm infraguide project including the federation of canadian municipalities infrastructure canada national research council of canada and canadian public works association seek to achieve sustainability in municipal infrastructure especially large scale urban infrastructure they advocate environmental protocols and inclusion of ecological and social indicators and factors in decision making at the earliest possible stage there is little focus yet on sustainable rural infrastructure though this is a stated goal of the project as is spreading it to achieve rural development in developing nations in their view sustainability concerns apply to all of maintaining repairing and upgrading the infrastructure that sustains our quality of life including at least municipal decision making and investment planning potable water supply stormwater and waste water especially minimizing the distance that such water travels to be treated and reused roads and sidewalks and their integration with transit systems to achieve smoother flow of people environmental protocols and multi-discipline practices to ensure they are respected e.g green procurement these and other canadian official entities including the auditor general of canada and service canada are focused on related efforts such as municipal performance audits information technology and communications technology moral purchasing and sharing of data information common infrastructure technology and the need to integrate their business processes to further reduce duplication and waste especially e-waste and greenhouse gas emissions
