clothes lines in tripoli in northern lebanon a clothes line or washing line is any type of rope cord or twine that has been stretched between two points e.g two sticks outside or indoors above the level of the ground clothing that has recently been washed is hung along the line to dry using clothes pegs or clothespins washing lines are attached either from a post or a wall and are frequently located in back gardens or on balconies longer washing lines often have props holding up sections in the middle due to the weight of the usually wet clothing more elaborate rotary washing lines save space and are typically retractable and square or triangular in shape with multiple lines being used such as the hills hoist from australia some can be folded up when not in use although there is a very minor hazard of getting fingers caught so there is usually a safety button in scotland many tenement buildings have a drying green which is a communal area predominantly used for clothes lines – it may also be used as a recreational space as well as a clothes horse connected to a pulley system inside which can be used in the frequently cold winter weather comparison edit a rotary or hills

mechanical clothes dryer per load 3 less fabric wear and tear 2 laundry items do not shrink hot air from a mechanical clothes dryer may shrink items no static cling and no perfume smells throughout the neighborhood from fabric softener and anti-static dryer sheets laundry items stay softer to the touch mechanical clothes dryers tend to remove short soft fine fibers and may be less wrinkled laundry items often do not need ironing if line dried in a breeze avoids the potential of airborne lint and reduced air quality eliminates the noise from a mechanical clothes dryer does not vent indoor air to the outside and waste the large volume of conditioned heated or cooled air that a mechanical dryer s blower does for a simple line drying arrangement rope and clothes pins the repair and replacement costs are about 20.00 per 1,000 loads of laundry or 2 cents per load for non-commercial mechanical clothes drying the repair and replacement costs including labor expenses are about 200.00 per 1,000 loads of laundry or 20 cents per load disadvantages edit putting laundry on a line usually takes more time than putting it into a mechanical dryer as laundry items have to be hung up and fixed one by one laundry items need to be hung indoors during rainy weather or may get wet if the weather changes neighbours may find it aesthetically unpleasant 1 exposing dirty laundry can lessen privacy showing information about inhabitants living habits risk of theft or vandalism of clothes environmental contaminants such as soil dust smoke automotive or industrial pollutants pollen and bird and animal droppings can come in contact with clothing clothespins can leave imprints including rust from the spring on the clothes drying laundry indoors edit clothes drying indoors laundry may be dried indoors rather than outdoors for a variety of reasons including inclement weather physical disability lack of space for a line reduce the damage to fabrics from sun s uv rays legal restrictions 4 to raise the humidity level indoors and lower the air temperature indoors convenience to preserve privacy several types of devices are available for indoor drying a drying rack or clotheshorse can help save space in an apartment or clothes lines can be strung in the basement during the winter small loads can simply be draped over furniture or a shower curtain pole the drying time indoors will typically be longer than outdoor drying because of the lack of direct solar radiation and the convective assistance of the wind the evaporation of the moisture from the clothes will cool the indoor air and increase the humidity level which may or may not be desirable in cold dry weather moderate increases in humidity make most people feel more comfortable in warm weather increased humidity makes most people feel even hotter increased humidity can also increase growth of fungi which can cause health problems an average-sized wash load will convert approximately 4965 kilojoules of ambient heat into latent heat that is stored in the evaporated water as follows a typical 4 kg load of laundry can contain 2.2 kg of water after being spun in a laundry machine 5 to determine how much heat has been converted in drying a load of laundry weigh the clothes when they are wet and then again after the clothes have dried the difference is the weight of the water that was evaporated from them multiply that weight in kg by 2,257 kj kg 6 which is the heat of vaporization per kilogram to obtain the number of kilojoules that went into evaporating the water or multiply by 0.6250 kwh kg to get kilowatt-hours note if the moisture later condenses inside the house the latent heat will be converted back into ambient heat which could increase the temperature of the air in the room slightly 7 to obtain a good approximation of the effect this would have in a particular situation the process can be traced on a psychrometric chart factors that determine the drying duration edit various factors determine the duration of drying and can help to decide rather to use a drier or a clothes line 8 the environmental temperature increase of temperature decreases the drying duration the environmental humidity decrease of humidity will decrease the drying duration wind velocity sometimes people put a fan near the clothes when drying them indoors direct sun usually only the external line will be exposed to direct sun so usually people put the thickest clothes on the most external line cloth thickness drying laundry in freezing conditions edit laundry may be dried outdoors when the temperature is well below the freezing point first the moisture in the laundry items will freeze and the clothing will become stiff then the frost on the clothes will sublimate into the air leaving the items dry it takes a long time and it is usually much quicker to dry them indoors however indoor drying removes heat from the air so it is a trade-off between speed and energy efficiency controversy in north america edit controversy surrounding the use of clothes lines has prompted many governments to pass right-to-dry laws allowing their use 1 according to ian urbina a reporter for the new york times the majority of the 60 million people who now live in the country’s roughly 300,000 private communities are forbidden from using outdoor clothes lines 9 as of august 2013 update the states of florida colorado 10 11 12 hawaii 13 arizona california illinois indiana louisiana maine maryland massachusetts nevada new mexico north carolina oregon texas vermont virginia and wisconsin had passed laws forbidding bans on clothes lines with utah allowing local jurisdictions to forbid such bans 14 at least eight states restrict homeowners associations from forbidding the installation of solar-energy systems and lawyers have debated whether or not those laws might apply to clothes lines a british filmmaker steven lake was planning to release a documentary in 2011 titled drying for freedom about the clothes-line controversy in the united states 9 in canada the province of nova scotia s first ndp government passed an act to prevent prohibitions on the use of clotheslines on december 10 2010 to allow all homeowners in the province to use clotheslines regardless of restrictive covenants 15 the province of ontario lifted bans on clothes lines in 2008 16 some other affluent suburban municipalities such as hampstead québec or outremont québec also prohibit clotheslines citation needed images edit clothes pins or pegs on a clothes line pegs on a clothes line washing line in iceland
