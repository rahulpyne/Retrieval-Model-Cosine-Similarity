embodied energy wikipedia embodied energy from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article is incomplete please help to improve it or discuss the issue on the talk page september 2011 embodied energy is the sum of all the energy required to produce any goods or services considered as if that energy was incorporated or embodied in the product itself the concept can be useful in determining the effectiveness of energy-producing or energy-saving devices or the real replacement cost of a building and because energy-inputs usually entail greenhouse gas emissions in deciding whether a product contributes to or mitigates global warming one fundamental purpose for measuring this quantity is to compare the amount of energy produced or saved by the product in question to the amount of energy consumed in producing it embodied energy is an accounting method which aims to find the sum total of the energy necessary for an entire product life-cycle determining what constitutes this life-cycle includes assessing the relevance and extent of energy into raw material extraction transport manufacture assembly installation disassembly deconstruction and or decomposition as well as human and secondary resources different methodologies produce different understandings of the scale and scope of application and the type of energy embodied history edit the history of constructing a system of accounts which records the energy flows through an environment can be traced back to the origins of accounting itself as a distinct method it is often associated with the physiocrat s substance theory of value 1 and later the agricultural energetics of sergei podolinsky a ukrainian physician 2 and the ecological energetics of vladmir stanchinsky 3 the main methods of embodied energy accounting as they are used today grew out of wassily leontief s input-output model and are called input-output embodied energy analysis leontief s input-output model was in turn an adaptation of the neo-classical theory of general equilibrium with application to the empirical study of the quantitative interdependence between interrelated economic activities 4 according to tennenbaum 5 leontief s input-output method was adapted to embodied energy analysis by hannon 6 to describe ecosystem energy flows hannon’s adaptation tabulated the total direct and indirect energy requirements the energy intensity for each output made by the system the total amount of energies direct and indirect for the entire amount of production was called the embodied energy embodied energy methodologies edit embodied energy analysis is interested in what energy goes to supporting a consumer and so all energy depreciation is assigned to the final demand of consumer different methodologies use different scales of data to calculate energy embodied in products and services of nature and human civilization international consensus on the appropriateness of data scales and methodologies is pending this difficulty can give a wide range in embodied energy values for any given material in the absence of a comprehensive global embodied energy public dynamic database embodied energy calculations may omit important data on for example the rural road highway construction and maintenance needed to move a product human marketing advertising catering services non-human services and the like such omissions can be a source of significant methodological error in embodied energy estimations 7 without an estimation and declaration of the embodied energy error it is difficult to calibrate the sustainability index and so the value of any given material process or service to environmental and human economic processes standards edit the sbtool uk code for sustainable homes and usa leed are methods in which the embodied energy of a product or material is rated along with other factors to assess a building s environmental impact embodied energy is a concept for which scientists have not yet agreed absolute universal values because there are many variables to take into account but most agree that products can be compared to each other to see which has more and which has less embodied energy comparative lists for an example see the university of bath embodied energy carbon material inventory 8 contain average absolute values and explain the factors which have been taken into account when compiling the lists typical embodied energy units used are mj kg mega joules of energy needed to make a kilogram of product tco 2 tonnes of carbon dioxide created by the energy needed to make a kilogram of product converting mj to tco 2 is not straightforward because different types of energy oil wind solar nuclear and so on emit different amounts of carbon dioxide so the actual amount of carbon dioxide emitted when a product is made will be dependent on the type of energy used in the manufacturing process for example the australian government 9 gives a global average of 0.098 tco 2 1 gj this is the same as 1 mj 0.098 kgco 2 98 gco 2 or 1 kgco 2 10.204 mj related methodologies edit in the 2000s drought conditions in australia have generated interest in the application of embodied energy analysis methods to water this has led to use of the concept of embodied water embodied energy in common materials edit selected data from

volkswagen the embodied energy contents of a golf a3 with a petrol engine amounts to 18 000 kwh i.e 12 of 545 gj as shown in the report 10 a golf a4 equipped with a turbocharged direct injection will show an embodied energy amounting to 22 000 kwh i.e 15 of 545 gj as shown in the report 10 according to the french energy and environment agency ademe 11 a motor car has an embodied energy contents of 20 800 kwh whereas an electric vehicle shows an embodied energy contents amounting to 34 700 kwh fuel edit as regards energy itself the factor energy returned on energy invested eroei of fuel can be estimated at 8 which means that to some amount of useful energy provided by fuel should be added 1 7 of that amount in embodied energy of the fuel in other words the fuel consumption should be augmented by 14 due to the fuel eroei road construction edit we have to work here with figures which prove still more difficult to obtain in the case of road construction the embodied energy would amount to 1 18 of the fuel consumption i.e 6 12 overall embodied energy of a car edit the environmental calculator of the french environment and energy agency shows the usual fuel consumption of different means of transportation if an embodied energy of 20 000 kwh is assumed when taking a distance of 200 000 km into account 10 kwh or one liter of gasoline per 100 km has to be added to the consumption moreover the eroei and the road construction represent approximately 20 of the fuel consumption for a consumption of 6,4 l 100 km it means that the corresponding embodied energy is equal to 1.3 l 100 km so that the overall embodied energy amounts to 2.3 l 100 km other figures available edit treloar et al have estimated the embodied energy in an average automobile in australia as 0.27 terajoules i.e 75 000 kwh as one component in an overall analysis of the energy involved in road transportation 13 embodied energy in buildings edit although most of the focus for improving energy efficiency in buildings has been on their operational emissions it is estimated that about 30 of all energy consumed throughout the lifetime of a building can be in its embodied energy this percentage varies based on factors such as age of building climate and materials in the past this percentage was much lower but as much focus has been placed on reducing operational emissions such as efficiency improvements in heating and cooling systems the embodied energy contribution has come much more into play examples of embodied energy include the energy used to extract raw resources process materials assemble product components transport between each step construction maintenance and repair deconstruction and disposal as such it is important to employ a whole-life carbon accounting framework in analyzing the carbon emissions in buildings 14 embodied energy in the energy field edit eroei provides a basis for evaluating the embodied energy due to energy thanks to eroei definition it is possible to evaluate the efficiency η \displaystyle \eta according to η eroei – 1 eroei \displaystyle \eta \frac \hbox eroei – 1 \hbox eroei under these circumstances final energy has to be multiplied by 1 eroei 1 \displaystyle \frac \hbox 1 \hbox eroei 1 in order to get primary energy given an eroei amounting to eight e.g. a seventh of the final energy has to be added to the final energy for obtaining primary energy not only that for really obtaining overall embodied energy embodied energy due to the construction and maintenance of power plants should be taken into account too here figures are badly needed in france by convention eroei related to electricity is equal to 2.58 1.58 15 i.e 1.633 corresponding to an efficiency of 0.3875 or 38.8 moreover if the grid efficiency is evaluated at 92.5 15 overall electricity efficiency in france amounts to 35.8 in germany on the contrary because of the swift development of the renewable energies the ratio between primary energy and final energy in electricity amounts to only 1.8 16 leading to an eroei of 1.8 0.8 2.25 corresponding to an efficiency of 55.5
