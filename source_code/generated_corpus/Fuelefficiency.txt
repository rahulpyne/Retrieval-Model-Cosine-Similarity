meaning the efficiency of a process that converts chemical potential energy contained in a carrier fuel into kinetic energy or work overall fuel efficiency may vary per device which in turn may vary per application fuel efficiency especially fossil fuel power plants or industries dealing with combustion such as ammonia production during the haber process in the context of transport fuel economy is the energy efficiency of a particular vehicle given as a ratio of distance traveled per unit of fuel consumed it is dependent on engine efficiency transmission design and tire design fuel economy is expressed in miles per gallon mpg in the usa and usually also in the uk imperial gallon there is sometimes confusion as the imperial gallon is 20 larger than the us gallon so that mpg values are not directly comparable in countries using the metric system fuel economy is stated as fuel consumption in liters per 100 kilometers l 100 km litres per mil are used in norway and sweden fuel consumption is a more accurate measure of a vehicle’s performance because it is a linear relationship while fuel economy leads to distortions in efficiency improvements 1 weight-specific efficiency efficiency per unit weight may be stated for freight and passenger-specific efficiency vehicle efficiency per passenger vehicle design edit fuel efficiency is dependent on many parameters of a vehicle including its engine parameters aerodynamic drag weight and rolling resistance there have been advances in all areas of vehicle design in recent decades hybrid vehicles use two or more power sources for propulsion in many designs a small combustion engine is combined with electric motors kinetic energy which would otherwise be lost to heat during braking is recaptured as electrical power to improve fuel efficiency engines automatically shut off when vehicles come to a stop and start again when the accelerator is pressed preventing wasted energy from idling 2 fleet efficiency edit fleet efficiency describes the average efficiency of a population of vehicles technological advances in efficiency may be offset by a change in buying habits with a propensity to heavier vehicles which are less efficient all else being equal energy efficiency terminology edit energy efficiency is similar to fuel efficiency but the input is usually in units of energy such as british thermal units btu megajoules mj gigajoules gj kilocalories kcal or kilowatt-hours kw·h the inverse of energy efficiency is energy intensity or the amount of input energy required for a unit of output such as mj passenger-km of passenger transport btu ton-mile or kj t-km of freight transport gj t for production of steel and other materials btu kw·h for electricity generation or litres 100 km of vehicle travel litres per 100 km is also a measure of energy intensity where the input is measured by the amount of fuel and the output is measured by the distance travelled for example fuel economy in automobiles given a heat value of a fuel it would be trivial to convert from fuel units such as litres of gasoline to energy units such as mj and conversely but there are two problems with comparisons made using energy units there are two different heat values for any hydrogen-containing fuel which can differ by several percent see below when comparing transportation energy costs it must be remembered that a kilowatt hour of electric energy may require an amount of fuel with heating value of 2 or 3 kilowatt hours to produce it energy content of fuel edit the specific energy content of a fuel is the heat energy obtained when a certain quantity is burned such as a gallon litre kilogram it is sometimes called the heat of combustion there exists two different values of specific heat energy for the same batch of fuel one is the high or gross heat of combustion and the other is the low or net heat of combustion the high value is obtained when after the combustion the water in the exhaust is in liquid form for the low value the exhaust has all the water in vapor form steam since water vapor gives up heat energy when it changes from vapor to liquid the liquid water value is larger since it includes the latent heat of vaporization of water the difference between the high and low values is significant about 8 or 9 this accounts for most of the apparent discrepancy in the heat value of gasoline in the u.s and the table the high heat values have traditionally been used but in many other countries the low heat values are commonly used fuel type mj l mj kg btu imp gal btu us gal research octane

gross heat of combustion nor the net heat of combustion gives the theoretical amount of mechanical energy work that can be obtained from the reaction this is given by the change in gibbs free energy and is around 45.7 mj kg for gasoline the actual amount of mechanical work obtained from fuel the inverse of the specific fuel consumption depends on the engine a figure of 17.6 mj kg is possible with a gasoline engine and 19.1 mj kg for a diesel engine see brake specific fuel consumption for more information fuel efficiency of motor vehicles edit see also fuel economy in automobiles the fuel efficiency of motor vehicles can be expressed in more ways fuel consumption is the amount of fuel used per unit distance for example litres per 100 kilometres l 100 km in this case the lower the value the more economic a vehicle is the less fuel it needs to travel a certain distance this is the measure generally used across europe except the uk denmark and the netherlands see below new zealand australia and canada also in uruguay paraguay guatemala colombia china and madagascar citation needed as also in post-soviet space fuel economy is the distance travelled per unit volume of fuel used for example kilometres per litre km l or miles per gallon mpg where 1 mpg imperial ≈ 0.354006 km l in this case the higher the value the more economic a vehicle is the more distance it can travel with a certain volume of fuel this measure is popular in the usa and the uk mpg but in europe india japan south korea and latin america the metric unit km l is used instead converting from mpg or to l 100 km or vice versa involves the use of the reciprocal function which is not distributive therefore the average of two fuel economy numbers gives different values if those units are used because one of the functions is reciprocal thus not linear if two people calculate the fuel economy average of two groups of cars with different units the group with better fuel economy may be one or the other however from the point of energy used as a shared method of measure the result shall be the same in both the cases the formula for converting to miles per us gallon exactly 3.785411784 l from l 100 km is 235.215 x \displaystyle \textstyle \frac 235.215 x where x \displaystyle x is value of l 100 km for miles per imperial gallon exactly 4.54609 l the formula is 282.481 x \displaystyle \textstyle \frac 282.481 x in parts of europe the two standard measuring cycles for litre 100 km value are urban traffic with speeds up to 50 km h from a cold start and then extra urban travel at various speeds up to 120 km h which follows the urban test a combined figure is also quoted showing the total fuel consumed in divided by the total distance traveled in both tests a reasonably modern european supermini and many mid-size cars including station wagons may manage motorway travel at 5 l 100 km 47 mpg us 56 mpg imp or 6.5 l 100 km in city traffic 36 mpg us 43 mpg imp with carbon dioxide emissions of around 140 g km an average north american mid-size car travels 21 mpg us 11 l 100 km city 27 mpg us 9 l 100 km highway a full-size suv usually travels 13 mpg us 18 l 100 km city and 16 mpg us 15 l 100 km highway pickup trucks vary considerably whereas a 4 cylinder-engined light pickup can achieve 28 mpg 8 l 100 km a v8 full-size pickup with extended cabin only travels 13 mpg us 18 l 100 km city and 15 mpg us 15 l 100 km highway the average fuel economy is higher in europe due to the higher cost of fuel in the uk a gallon of gas without tax would cost us 1.97 but with taxes cost us 6.06 in 2005 the average cost in the united states was us 2.61 consumers prefer muscle cars but choose more fuel efficient ones when gas prices increase 4 european-built cars are generally more fuel-efficient than us vehicles while europe has many higher efficiency diesel cars european gasoline vehicles are on average also more efficient than gasoline-powered vehicles in the usa most european vehicles cited in the csi study run on diesel engines which tend to achieve greater fuel efficiency than gas engines selling those cars in the united states is difficult because of emission standards notes walter mcmanus a fuel economy expert at the university of michigan transportation research institute for the most part european diesels don’t meet u.s emission standards mcmanus said in 2007 another reason why many european models are not marketed in the united states is that labor unions object to having the big 3 import any new foreign built models regardless of fuel economy while laying off workers at home 5 an example of european cars capabilities of fuel economy is the microcar smart fortwo cdi which can achieve up to 3.4 l 100 km 69.2 mpg us using a turbocharged three-cylinder 41 bhp 30 kw diesel engine the fortwo is produced by daimler ag and is currently only sold by one company in the united states furthermore the current and to date already 10-year-old world record in fuel economy of production cars is held by the volkswagen group with special production models labeled 3l of the volkswagen lupo and the audi a2 consuming as little as 3 l 100 km 94 mpg imp 78 mpg us 6 diesel engines generally achieve greater fuel efficiency than petrol gasoline engines passenger car diesel engines have energy efficiency of up to 41 but more typically 30 and petrol engines of up to 37.3 but more typically 20 that is one of the reasons why diesels have better fuel efficiency than equivalent petrol cars a common margin is 25 more miles per gallon for an efficient turbodiesel for example the current model skoda octavia using volkswagen engines has a combined european fuel efficiency of 41.3 mpg for the 105 bhp 78 kw petrol engine and 52.3 mpg for the 105 bhp 78 kw — and heavier — diesel engine the higher compression ratio is helpful in raising the energy efficiency but diesel fuel also contains approximately 10 more energy per unit volume than gasoline which contributes to the reduced fuel consumption for a given power output in 2002 the united states had 85,174,776 trucks and averaged 13.5 miles per us gallon 17.4 l 100 km 16.2 mpg imp

100 km 27.6 mpg imp average fuel economy in the united states gradually declined until 1973 when it reached a low of 13.4 miles per us gallon 17.6 l 100 km 16.1 mpg imp and gradually has increased since as a result of higher fuel cost 8 a study indicates that a 10 increase in gas prices will eventually produce a 2.04 increase in fuel economy 9 one method by car makers to increase fuel efficiency is lightweighting in which lighter-weight materials are substituted in for improved engine performance and handling 10 fuel efficiency in microgravity edit how fuel combusts affects how much energy is produced the national aeronautics and space administration nasa has investigated fuel consumption in microgravity the common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on convection because soot tends to rise to the top of a flame such as in a candle making the flame yellow in microgravity or zero gravity such as an environment in outer space convection no longer occurs and the flame becomes spherical with a tendency to become more blue and more efficient there are several possible explanations for this difference of which the most likely one given is the hypothesis that the temperature is evenly distributed enough that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs. national aeronautics and space administration april 2005 experiments by nasa in microgravity reveal that diffusion flames in microgravity allow more soot to be completely oxidised after they are produced than diffusion flames on earth because of a series of mechanisms that behaved differently in microgravity when compared to normal gravity conditions lsp-1 experiment results national aeronautics and space administration april 2005 premixed flames in microgravity burn at a much slower rate and more efficiently than even a candle on earth and last much longer 11 transportation edit fuel efficiency in transportation edit main article energy efficiency in transportation vehicle efficiency and transportation pollution edit main articles gas-guzzler and vehicle efficiency initiative fuel efficiency directly affects emissions causing pollution by affecting the amount of fuel used however it also depends on the fuel source used to drive the vehicle concerned cars for example can run on a number of fuel types other than gasoline such as natural gas lpg or biofuel or electricity which creates various quantities of atmospheric pollution a kilogram of carbon whether contained in petrol diesel kerosene or any other hydrocarbon fuel in a vehicle leads to approximately 3.6 kg of co 2 emissions 12 due to the carbon content of gasoline its combustion emits 2.3 kg l 19.4 lb us gal of co 2 since diesel fuel is more energy dense per unit volume diesel emits 2.6 kg l 22.2 lb us gal 12 this figure is only the co 2 emissions of the final fuel product and does not include additional co 2 emissions created during the drilling pumping transportation and refining steps required to produce the fuel additional measures to reduce overall emission includes improvements to the efficiency of air conditioners lights and tires driving technique edit main article energy-efficient driving many drivers have the potential to improve their fuel efficiency significantly 13 these five basic fuel-efficient driving techniques can be effective simple things such as keeping tires properly inflated having a vehicle well-maintained and avoiding idling can dramatically improve fuel efficiency 14 there is a growing community of enthusiasts known as hypermilers who develop and practice driving techniques to increase fuel efficiency and reduce consumption hypermilers have broken records of fuel efficiency for example achieving 109 miles per gallon in a prius in non-hybrid vehicles these techniques are also beneficial with fuel efficiencies of up to 59 mpg in a honda accord or 30 mpg in an acura mdx 15 advanced technology improvements to improve fuel efficiency edit the most efficient machines for converting energy to rotary motion are electric motors as used in electric vehicles however electricity is not a primary energy source so the efficiency of the electricity production has also to be taken into account currently railway trains can be powered using electricity delivered through an additional running rail overhead catenary system or by on-board generators used in diesel-electric locomotives as common on the us and uk rail networks pollution produced from centralised generation of electricity is emitted at a distant power station rather than on site pollution can be reduced by using more railway electrification and low carbon power for electricity some railways such as the french sncf and swiss federal railways derive most if not 100 of their power from hydroelectric or nuclear power stations therefore atmospheric pollution from their rail networks is very low this was reflected in a study by aea technology between a eurostar train and airline journeys between london and paris which showed the trains on average emitting 10 times less co 2 per passenger than planes helped in part by french nuclear generation 16 in the future hydrogen cars may be commercially available toyota is test marketing hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles in southern california where a series of hydrogen fueling stations has been established powered either through chemical reactions in a fuel cell that create electricity to drive very efficient electrical motors or by directly burning hydrogen in a combustion engine near identically to a natural gas vehicle and similarly compatible with both natural gas and gasoline these vehicles promise to have near-zero pollution from the tailpipe exhaust pipe potentially the atmospheric pollution could be minimal provided the hydrogen is made by electrolysis using electricity from non-polluting sources such as solar wind or hydroelectricity or nuclear commercial hydrogen production uses fossil fuels and produces more carbon dioxide than hydrogen because there are pollutants involved in the manufacture and destruction of a car and the production transmission and storage of electricity and hydrogen the use of the label zero pollution should be understood as applying only to the car s conversion of stored energy into transportation in 2004 a consortium of major auto-makers — bmw general motors honda toyota and volkswagen audi — came up with top tier detergent gasoline standard to gasoline brands in the us and canada that meet their minimum standards for detergent content 17 and do not contain metallic additives top tier gasoline contains higher levels of detergent additives in order to prevent the build-up of deposits typically on fuel injector and intake valve known to reduce fuel economy and engine performance 18
