the demonym for a moscow resident is москвич moskvich for male or москвич ка moskvichka for female rendered in english as muscovite etymology edit the name of the city is thought to be derived from the name of the moskva river 15 16 there have been proposed several theories of the origin of the name of the river the most linguistically well-grounded and widely accepted is from the proto-balto-slavic root mŭzg muzg from the proto-indo-european meu wet 16 17 18 so the name moskva might signify a river at a wetland or a marsh 15 its cognates include russian музга muzga pool puddle lithuanian mazgoti and latvian mazgāt to wash sanskrit majjati to drown latin mergō to dip immerse 15 17 there exist as well similar place names in poland like mozgawa 15 16 17 the original old russian form of the name is reconstructed as Москы mosky 15 16 hence it was one of a few slavic ū stem nouns as with other nouns of that declension it had been undergoing a morphological transformation at the early stage of the development of the language as a result the first written mentions in the 12th century were Московь moskovĭ accusative case Москви moskvi locative case Москвe Москвѣ moskve moskvě genitive case 15 16 from the latter forms came the modern russian name Москва moskva which is a result of morphological generalization with the numerous slavic ā stem nouns however the form moskovĭ has left some traces in many other languages such as english moscow german moskau french moscou latvian maskava ottoman turkish moskov ‎ tatar Мәскәү mäskäw kazakh Мәскеу mäskew chuvash Мускав muskav etc in a similar manner the latin name moscovia has been formed later it became a colloquial name for russia used in western europe in the 16th–17th centuries from it as well came english muscovy various other theories of celtic iranian caucasic finno-ugrian origin having little or no scientific ground are now largely rejected by contemporary linguists 15 16 there has been as well a naïve scholastic etymology that connected the name of mosoch a son of japheth with the name of the city so that it was thought that the biblical figure was a forefather of russians as well as other slavs the surface similarity of the name russia with rosh an obscure biblical tribe or country which is mentioned alongside with mosoch in ezekiel 38 2–3 39 1 strengthened up such

churches — город сорока сороков церквей —prior to 1917 in 1918 the bolshevik government declared russia a secular state which in practice meant that religion was repressed and society was to become atheistic during the period of 1920-1930s a great number of churches in moscow were demolished including historical chudov monastery in the kremlin dating from the 14th century kazansky cathedral on the red square the cathedral of christ the savior constructed in the 19th century in memory of a victory over napoleon s army in 1812 and many more this continued even after the second world war in 1940-1970s when persecutions against religion in the soviet union became less severe most of the surviving churches and monasteries were closed and then used as clubs offices factories or even warehouses since the disintegration of the soviet union in 1991 many of the destroyed churches have been restored and traditional religions are once again gaining popularity among the churches

view from the central children s store on lubyanka square architecture edit saint basil s cathedral in moscow the masterpiece of russian architecture moscow s architecture is world-renowned moscow is the site of saint basil’s cathedral with its elegant onion domes as well as the cathedral of christ the savior and the seven sisters the first kremlin was built in the middle of the 12th century medieval moscow s design was of concentric walls and intersecting radial thoroughfares this layout as well as moscow s rivers helped shape moscow s design in subsequent centuries new arbat avenue the kremlin was rebuilt in the 15th century its towers and some of its churches were built by italian architects lending the city some of the aura of the renaissance from the end of the 15th century the city was embellished by masonry structures such as monasteries palaces walls towers and churches the city s appearance had not changed much by the 18th century houses were made of pine and spruce logs with shingled roofs plastered with sod or covered by birch bark the rebuilding of moscow in the second half of the 18th century was necessitated not only by constant fires but also the needs of the nobility much of the wooden city was replaced by buildings in the classical style 64 for much of its architectural history moscow was dominated by orthodox churches however the overall appearance of the city changed drastically during soviet times especially as a result of joseph stalin s large-scale effort to modernize moscow stalin s plans for the city included a network of broad avenues and roadways some of them over ten lanes wide which while greatly simplifying movement through the city were constructed at the expense of a great number of historical buildings and districts among the many casualties of stalin s demolitions was the sukharev tower a longtime city landmark as well as mansions and commercial buildings the city s newfound status as the capital of a deeply secular nation made religiously significant buildings especially vulnerable to demolition many of the city s churches which in most cases were some of moscow s oldest and most prominent buildings were destroyed some notable examples include the kazan cathedral and the cathedral of christ the savior during the 1990s both were rebuilt many smaller churches however were lost 65 while the later stalinist period was characterized by the curtailing of creativity and architectural innovation the earlier post-revolutionary years saw a plethora of radical new buildings created in the city especially notable were the constructivist architects associated with vkhutemas responsible for such landmarks as lenin s mausoleum another prominent architect was vladimir shukhov famous for shukhov tower just one of many hyperboloid towers designed by shukhov it was built between 1919 and 1922 as a transmission tower for a russian broadcasting company 66 shukhov also left a lasting legacy to the constructivist architecture of early soviet russia he designed spacious elongated shop galleries most notably the gum department store on red square 66 bridged with innovative metal-and-glass vaults moscow kremlin novodevichy convent ostankino tower the tallest freestanding structure in europe and 8th tallest in the world monument to the conquerors of space perhaps the most recognizable contributions of the stalinist period are the so-called seven sisters comprising seven massive skyscrapers scattered throughout the city at about an equal distance from the kremlin a defining feature of moscow’s skyline their imposing form was allegedly inspired by the manhattan municipal building in new york city and their style—with intricate exteriors and a large central spire—has been described as stalinist gothic architecture all seven towers can be seen from most high points in the city they are among the tallest constructions in central moscow apart from the ostankino tower which when it was completed in 1967 was the highest free-standing land structure in the world and today remains the world’s seventy-second tallest ranking among buildings such as the burj khalifa in dubai taipei 101 in taiwan and the cn tower in toronto 67 the soviet goal of providing housing for every family and the rapid growth of moscow s population led to the construction of large monotonous housing blocks most of these date from the post-stalin era and the styles are often named after the leader then in power brezhnev khrushchev etc they are usually badly maintained although the city still has some five-story apartment buildings constructed before the mid-1960s more recent apartment buildings are usually at least nine floors tall and have elevators it is estimated that moscow has over twice as many elevators as new york city and four times as many as chicago moslift one of the city s major elevator operating companies has about 1500 elevator mechanics on call to release residents trapped in elevators 68 stalinist-era buildings mostly found in the central part of the city are massive and usually ornamented with socialist realism motifs that imitate classical themes however small churches – almost always eastern orthodox – found across the city provide glimpses of its past the old arbat street a tourist street that was once the heart of a bohemian area preserves most of its buildings from prior to the 20th century many buildings found off the main streets of the inner city behind the stalinist façades of tverskaya street for example are also examples of bourgeois architecture typical of tsarist times ostankino palace kuskovo uzkoye and other large estates just outside moscow originally belong to nobles from the tsarist era and some convents and monasteries both inside and outside the city are open to muscovites and tourists red square painting by fedor alekseev 1801 attempts are being made to restore many of the city’s best-kept examples of pre-soviet architecture these restored structures are easily spotted by their bright new colors and spotless façades there are a few examples of notable early soviet avant-garde work too such as the house of the architect konstantin melnikov in the arbat area many of these restorations were criticized for alleged disrespect of historical authenticity facadism is also widely practiced 69 later examples of interesting soviet architecture are usually marked by their impressive size and the semi modernist styles employed such as with the novy arbat project familiarly known as false teeth of moscow and notorious for the wide-scale disruption of a historic area in central moscow involved in the project plaques on house exteriors will inform passers-by that a well-known personality once lived there frequently the plaques are dedicated to soviet celebrities not well-known outside or often like with decorated generals and revolutionaries now both inside of russia there are also many museum houses of famous russian writers composers and artists in the city moscow s skyline is quickly modernizing with several new towers under construction in recent years the city administration has been widely criticized for heavy destruction that has affected many historical buildings as much as a third of historic moscow has been destroyed in the past few years 70 to make space for luxury apartments and hotels 71 other historical buildings including such landmarks as the 1930 moskva hotel and the 1913 department store voyentorg have been razed and reconstructed anew with the inevitable loss of historical value critics blame the government for not enforcing conservation laws in the last 12 years more than 50 buildings with monument status were torn down several of those dating back to the 17th century 72 some critics also wonder if the money used for the reconstruction of razed buildings could not be used for the renovation of decaying structures which include many works by architect konstantin melnikov 73 and mayakovskaya metro station some organizations such as moscow architecture preservation society 74 and save europe s heritage 75 are trying to draw the international public attention to these problems 76 parks and landmarks edit see also list of moscow tourist attractions red square is a world heritage site novodevichy convent is a world heritage
