energy in the united states accounted for 13.44 percent of the domestically produced electricity in 2015 2 and 11.1 percent of total energy generation 3 as of 2014 more than 143,000 people work in the solar industry and 43 states deploy net metering where energy utilities buy back excess power generated by solar arrays 4 renewable energy reached a major milestone in the first quarter of 2011 when it contributed 11.7 percent of total u.s energy production 2.245 quadrillion btu of energy surpassing energy production from nuclear power 2.125 quadrillion btu 5 2011 was the first year since 1997 that renewables exceeded nuclear in us total energy production 6 hydroelectric power is currently the largest producer of renewable power in the u.s it produced around 6.14 of the nation s total electricity in 2015 which was 45.71 of the total renewable power in the u.s 7 the united states is the fourth largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world after china canada and brazil the grand coulee dam is the 5th largest hydroelectric power station in the world u.s wind power installed capacity now exceeds 72,000 mw and supplies 4.1 of the nation s electricity 8 9 texas is firmly established as the leader in wind power development followed by iowa and california 10 since the u.s pioneered the technology with solar one several solar thermal power stations have also been built the largest of these solar thermal power stations are the ivanpah solar power facility 392 mw southwest of las vegas and the segs group of plants in the mojave desert with a total generating capacity of 354 mw 11 large photovoltaic power plants in the usa include solar star 579 mw near rosamond california the desert sunlight solar farm a 550 mw solar power plant in riverside county california 12 and the topaz solar farm a 550 mw photovoltaic power plant in san luis obispo county california 13 the geysers in northern california is the largest complex of geothermal energy production in the world the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency marks a new era of energy exploration in the united states according to president barack obama 14 in a joint address to the congress on february 24 2009 president obama called for doubling renewable energy within the next three years 15 in his 2012 state of the union address president barack obama restated his commitment to renewable energy and mentioned the long-standing interior department commitment to permit 10,000 mw of renewable energy projects on public land in 2012 16 rationale for renewables edit renewable energy technologies encompass a broad diverse array of technologies including solar photovoltaics solar thermal power plants and heating cooling systems wind farms hydroelectricity geothermal power plants and ocean power systems and the use of biomass the report outlook on renewable energy in america explains that america needs renewable energy for many reasons america needs energy that is secure reliable improves public health protects the environment addresses climate change creates jobs and provides technological leadership america needs renewable energy if renewable energy is to be developed to its full potential america will need coordinated sustained federal and state policies that expand renewable energy markets promote and deploy new technology and provide appropriate opportunities to encourage renewable energy use in all critical energy market sectors wholesale and distributed electricity generation thermal energy applications and transportation 17 another benefit of some renewable energy technologies like wind and solar photovoltaics pv is that they require little or no water to generate electricity whereas thermoelectric fossil fuel based power plants require vast amounts of water for operation in 2009 president barack obama in the inaugural address called for the expanded use of renewable energy to meet the twin challenges of energy security and climate change those were the first references ever to the nation s energy use to renewable resources and to climate change in an inauguration speech of a u.s president president obama looked to the near future saying that as a nation the united states will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories 18 the president s new energy for america plan calls for a federal investment of 150 billion over the next decade to catalyze private efforts to build a clean energy future specifically the plan calls for renewable energy to supply 10 of the nation s electricity by 2012 rising to 25 by 2025 18 in his joint address to congress in 2009 obama stated that we know the country that harnesses the power of clean renewable energy will lead the 21st century....thanks to our recovery plan we will double this nation’s supply of renewable energy in the next three years.. it is time for america to lead again 15 according to clean edge there s little doubt that the future of energy will be cleaner the transition from carbon-intensive energy sources like wood coal and oil to natural gas and renewables is well underway for much of the developed world and for developing nations the future looks increasingly like it will be built off of a mix of energy efficiency renewables the electrification of transport and lower carbon fuels like natural gas 19 a 2010 survey conducted by applied materials shows that two-thirds of americans believe solar technology should play a greater role in meeting the country s energy needs in addition three-quarters of americans feel that increasing renewable energy and decreasing u.s dependence on foreign oil are the country s top energy priorities according to the survey 67 percent of americans would be willing to pay more for their monthly utility bill if their utility company increased its use of renewable energy 20 in a 2010 chicago council on global affairs public opinion survey an overwhelming 91 percent believed investing in renewable energy is important for the united states to remain economically competitive with other countries with 62 percent considering this very important the same poll found strong support for tax incentives to encourage development of renewable energy sources specifically as a way to reduce foreign energy imports eight in ten 80 percent favored tax incentives 47 percent strongly and only 17 percent were opposed 21 as of 2011 new evidence has emerged that there are considerable risks associated with traditional energy sources and that major changes to the mix of energy technologies is needed several mining tragedies globally have underscored the human toll of the coal supply chain new epa initiatives targeting air toxics coal ash and effluent releases highlight the environmental impacts of coal and the cost of addressing them with control technologies the use of fracking in natural gas exploration is coming under scrutiny with evidence of groundwater contamination and greenhouse gas emissions concerns are increasing about the vast amounts of water used at coal-fired and nuclear power plants particularly in regions of the country facing water shortages events at the fukushima nuclear plant have renewed doubts about the ability to operate large numbers of nuclear plants safely over the long term further cost estimates for “next generation” nuclear units continue to climb and lenders are unwilling to finance these plants without taxpayer guarantees 22 current trends edit percentage of electricity in the us generated from renewable sources 1950-2012 hydropower in blue and other renewable sources in red renewable energy in the united states accounted for 13.44 percent of the domestically produced electricity in 2015 23 california is a leading state and around 29 percent of california s electricity comes from rps eligible renewable sources including hydropower 24 the united states has some of the best renewable energy resources in the world which have the potential to meet a rising and significant share of the nation s energy demand a quarter of the u.s land area has winds strong enough to generate electricity at the same price as natural gas and coal 25 many of the new technologies that harness renewables — including wind solar geothermal and biofuels — are or soon will be economically competitive with the fossil fuels that meet 85 percent of u.s energy needs dynamic growth rates are driving down costs and spurring rapid advances in technologies 25 energy technologies also receive government subsidies in 2013 federal government energy-specific subsidies and supports for renewables fossil fuels and nuclear were 15.043 billion 3.431 billion and 1.66 billion respectively the subsidies and supports specific to electricity production amount to 11.678 billion 1.591 billion and 1.66 billion respectively 26 all but a few u.s states now have incentives in place to promote renewable energy while more than a dozen have enacted new renewable energy laws in recent years 25 renewable energy suffered a political setback in the united states in september 2011 with the

solar water heating edit the u.s department of energy stated in 2006 that more than 1.5 million homes and businesses were currently using solar water heating in the united states representing a capacity of over 1,000 megawatts mw of thermal energy generation it predicted that another 400 mw was likely to be installed over the next 3–5 years assuming that 40 percent of existing homes in the united states have adequate access to sunlight 29 million solar water heaters could be installed 88 solar water heaters can operate in any climate performance varies depending on how much solar energy is available at the site as well as how cold the water coming into the system is the colder the water the more efficiently the system operates 88 solar water heaters reduce the need for conventional water heating by about two-thirds and pay for their installation within 4 to 8 years with electricity or natural gas savings compared to those with electric water heaters florida homeowners with solar water heaters save 50 to 85 percent on their water heating bills according to the florida solar energy center 88 biomass edit main article biomass in 2015 biomass generated 64.19 million megawatt-hours 1.57 of total us generated electricity it was the largest source of total renewable energy in the us and the third-largest renewable source of electrical power in the us after hydropower and wind 89 biomass is biological material derived from living or recently living organisms such as plants and trees and utilizes wastes or plant matter specifically grown to generate electricity or produce heat the main advantage of using grown fuels as opposed to fossil fuels such as coal natural gas and oil is that while they are growing they absorb the near-equivalent in carbon dioxide an important greenhouse gas to that which is later released in their burning although there is some debate over the net carbon neutrality and near term affects of using the biomass for energy a key difference is the relatively short carbon recycle period of grown biomass several years or decades as opposed to the millions of years it took to turn carbon into fossil fuels with proper conservation and growing techniques biomass can be an important renewable energy source biomass can be utilized for all three major energy needs electricity heating cooling and transportation fuels however each usage is distinctly different from the others especially regarding efficiency the percentage of energy utilized from the biomass source whereas pellets for heating can be up to 90 efficient bio-electricity plants are comparable to coal power plants with around 30 efficiency and biofuels from crops or algae even less biomass electric generation data combines two basic categories 1 wood and wood derived fuels including wood wood waste solids including paper pellets railroad ties utility poles wood chiips bark and wood waste solids wood waste liquids red liquor sludge wood spent sulfite liquor and other wood based liquids and black liquor and 2 other biomass fuels include municipal solid waste landfill gas sludge waste agricultural byproducts other biomass solids other biomass liquids and other biomass gases including digester gases methane and other biomass gases the contribution from these two categories over the last ten years of biomass electric power to the

on pump california main article biofuel in the united states most cars on the road today in the u.s can run on blends of up to 10 ethanol and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends ford daimlerchrysler and gm are among the automobile companies that sell “flexible-fuel” cars trucks and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85 ethanol e85 by mid-2006 there were approximately six million e85-compatible vehicles on u.s roads 91 the challenge is to expand the market for biofuels beyond the farm states where they have been most popular to date 92 flex-fuel vehicles are assisting in this transition because they allow drivers to choose different fuels based on price and availability the energy independence and security act of 2007 which calls for 15.2 billion us gallons 58,000,000 m 3 of biofuels to be used annually by 2012 will also help to expand the market 91 the expanding ethanol and biodiesel industries are providing jobs in plant construction operations and maintenance mostly in rural communities according to the renewable fuels association the ethanol industry created almost 154,000 u.s jobs in 2005 alone boosting household income by 5.7 billion it also contributed about 3.5 billion in tax revenues at the local state and federal levels 91 on the other hand in 2010 the biofuel industry received 6644 million in federal government support 93 wave power edit main article wave power in the united states pb150 powerbuoy with peak-rated power output of 150 kw wave power in the united states is under development in several locations off the east west coasts as well as hawaii it has moved beyond the research phase and is producing reliable energy its use to-date has been for situations where other forms of energy production are not economically viable and as such the power output is currently modest but major installations are planned to come on-line within the next few years citation needed renewable energy research edit there are numerous organizations within the academic federal and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy this research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields 94 multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on renewable energy in recent years two of the most prominent of these labs are sandia national laboratories and the national renewable energy laboratory nrel both of which are funded by the united states department of energy and supported by various corporate partners 95 sandia has a total budget of 2.4 billion 96 while nrel has a budget of 375 million 97 both sandia national laboratories and the national renewable energy laboratory nrel have heavily funded solar research programs british petroleum was also heavily invested in solar research programs until 2008 when the company began scaling back its solar operations the company finally shut down its forty-year-old solar business after executives decided solar power production is not economically competitive 98 the nrel solar program has a budget of around 75 million 99 and develops research projects in the areas of photovoltaic pv technology solar thermal energy and solar radiation 100 the budget for sandia’s solar division is unknown however it accounts for a significant percentage of the laboratory’s 2.4 billion budget 101 several academic programs have focused on solar research in recent years the solar energy research center serc at university of north carolina unc has the sole purpose of developing cost effective solar technology in 2008 researchers at massachusetts institute of technology mit developed a method to store solar energy by using it to produce hydrogen fuel from water 102 such research is targeted at addressing the obstacle that solar development faces of storing energy for use during nighttime hours when the sun is not shining in february 2012 north carolina-based semprius inc. a solar development company backed by german corporation siemens announced that they had developed the world’s most efficient solar panel the company claims that the prototype converts 33.9 of the sunlight that hits it to electricity more than double the previous high-end conversion rate 103 wind energy research dates back several decades to the 1970s when nasa developed an analytical model to predict wind turbine power generation during high winds 104 today both sandia national laboratories and national renewable energy laboratory have programs dedicated to wind research sandia’s laboratory focuses on the advancement of materials aerodynamics and sensors 105 the nrel wind projects are centered on improving wind plant power production reducing their capital costs and making wind energy more cost effective overall 106 the field laboratory for optimized wind energy flowe at caltech was established to research renewable approaches to wind energy farming technology practices that have the potential to reduce the cost size and environmental impact of wind energy production 107 as the primary source of biofuels in north america many organizations are conducting research in the area of ethanol production on the federal level the usda conducts a large amount of research regarding ethanol production in the united states much of this research is targeted toward the effect of ethanol production on domestic food markets 108 the national renewable energy laboratory has conducted various ethanol research projects mainly in the area of cellulosic ethanol 109 cellulosic ethanol has many benefits over traditional corn based-ethanol it does not take away or directly conflict with the food supply because it is produced from wood grasses or non-edible parts of plants 110 moreover some studies have shown cellulosic ethanol to be more cost effective and economically sustainable than corn-based ethanol 111 sandia national laboratories conducts in-house cellulosic ethanol research 112 and is also a member of the joint bioenergy institute jbei a research institute founded by the united states department of energy with the goal of developing cellulosic biofuels 113 over 1 billion of federal money has been spent on the research and development of hydrogen fuel in the united states 114 both the national renewable energy laboratory 115 and sandia national laboratories 116 have departments dedicated to hydrogen research policy and promotion edit in his january 24 2012 state of the union address president barack obama restated his commitment to renewable energy stating that he “will not walk away from the promise of clean energy.” obama called for a commitment by the defense department to purchase 1,000 mw of renewable energy he also mentioned the long-standing interior department commitment to permit 10,000 mw of renewable energy projects on public land in 2012 16 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 included more than 70 billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs this policy-stimulus combination represents the largest federal commitment in u.s history for renewable energy advanced transportation and energy conservation initiatives these new initiatives were expected to encourage many more utilities to strengthen their clean energy programs 117 while the department of energy has come under criticism for providing loan guarantees to solyndra 118 its sunshot initiative has funded successful companies such as energysage 119 and zep solar 120 initiatives edit sunshot edit in february 2011 the u.s department of energy doe launched its sunshot initiative a collaborative national effort to cut the total cost of photovoltaic solar energy systems by 75 by 2020 121 reaching this goal would make unsubsidized solar energy cost-competitive with other forms of electricity and get grid parity 122 the sunshot initiative included a crowdsourced innovation program run in partnership with topcoder during which 17 different solar energy application solutions were developed in 60 days 123 wind powering america edit wind powering america wpa is another doe initiative that seeks to increase the use of wind energy wpa collaborates with state and regional stakeholders including farmers ranchers native americans rural electric cooperatives consumer-owned utilities and

million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy on-site each year enough to power more than 61,000 average u.s homes 128 renewable portfolio standards edit a renewable portfolio standard refers to legislation that creates a market in tradeable renewable or green electricity certificates electricity distributors or wholesaler purchasers of electricity are required to source a specified percentage of their electricity portfolio from renewable generation sources liable entities that fall short of their quota can purchase certificates from accredited suppliers who have generated renewable electricity and obtained and registered certificates to sell on that market sales to the grid edit the energy policy act of 2005 requires all public electric utilities to facilitate net metering 129 this allows homes and businesses performing distributed generation to pay only the net cost of electricity from the grid electricity used minus electricity produced locally and sent back into the grid for intermittent renewable energy sources this effectively uses the grid as a battery to smooth over lulls and fill in production gaps some jurisdictions go one step further and have instituted feed-in tariff which allows any power customer to actually make money by producing more renewable energy than is consumed locally distribution effects edit from 2006-14 us households received more than 18 billion in federal income tax credits for weatherizing their homes installing solar panels buying hybrid and electric vehicles and other clean energy investments these tax expenditures went predominantly to higher-income americans the bottom three income quintiles received about 10 of all credits while the top quintile received about 60 the most extreme is the program aimed at electric vehicles where the top income quintile received about 90 of all credits market mechanisms have less skewed distributional effects 130 renewable energy organizations edit the american
