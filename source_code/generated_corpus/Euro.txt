the frankfurt based european central bank ecb and the eurosystem composed of the central banks of the eurozone countries as an independent central bank the ecb has sole authority to set monetary policy the eurosystem participates in the printing minting and distribution of notes and coins in all member states and the operation of the eurozone payment systems the 1992 maastricht treaty obliges most eu member states to adopt the euro upon meeting certain monetary and budgetary convergence criteria although not all states have done so the united kingdom and denmark negotiated exemptions 15 while sweden which joined the eu in 1995 after the maastricht treaty was signed turned down the euro in a 2003 referendum and has circumvented the obligation to adopt the euro by not meeting the monetary and budgetary requirements all nations that have joined the eu since 1993 have pledged to adopt the euro in due course issuing modalities for banknotes edit since 5 january 2002 the national

equally weighted 17 characteristics edit coins and banknotes edit main articles euro coins and euro banknotes euro coins and banknotes of various denominations the euro is divided into 100 cents sometimes referred to as euro cents especially when distinguishing them from other currencies and referred to as such on the common side of all cent coins in community legislative acts the plural forms of euro and cent are spelled without the s notwithstanding normal english usage 18 19 otherwise normal english plurals are sometimes used 20 with many local variations such as centime in france all circulating coins have a common side showing the denomination or value and a map in the background due to the linguistic plurality of europe the latin alphabet version of euro is used as opposed to the less common greek or cyrillic and arabic numerals other text is used on national sides in national languages but other text on the common side is avoided for the denominations except the 1- 2 and 5-cent coins the map only showed the 15 member states which were members when the euro was introduced beginning in 2007 or 2008 depending on the country the old map is being replaced by a map of europe also showing countries outside the union like norway the 1- 2 and 5-cent coins however keep their old design showing a geographical map of europe with the 15 member states of 2002 raised somewhat above the rest of the map all common sides were designed by luc luycx the coins also have a national side showing an image specifically chosen by the country that issued the coin euro coins from any member state may be freely used in any nation that has adopted the euro the new banknotes were introduced in the beginning of 2013 the top half of the image shows the front side of the banknote and the bottom half shows the back side 10 euro note from the new europa series written in latin euro and greek eypΩ alphabets but also in the cyrillic ЕВРО alphabet as a result of bulgaria joining the european union in 2007 the coins are issued in €2 €1 50c 20c 10c 5c 2c and 1c denominations to avoid the use of the two smallest coins some cash transactions are rounded to the nearest five cents in the netherlands and ireland 21 22 by voluntary agreement and in finland by law 23 this practice is discouraged by the commission as is the practice of certain shops to refuse to accept high value euro notes 24 commemorative coins with €2 face value have been issued with changes to the design of the national side of the coin these include both commonly issued coins such as the €2 commemorative coin for the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the treaty of rome and nationally issued coins such as the coin to commemorate the 2004 summer olympics issued by greece these coins are legal tender throughout the eurozone collector coins with various other denominations have been issued as well but these are not intended for general circulation and they are legal tender only in the member state that issued them 25 the design for the euro banknotes has common designs on both sides the design was created by the austrian designer robert kalina 26 notes are issued in €500 €200 €100 €50 €20 €10 €5 each banknote has its own colour and is dedicated to an artistic period of european architecture the front of the note features windows or gateways while the back has bridges symbolising links between countries and with the future while the designs are supposed to be devoid of any identifiable characteristics the initial designs by robert kalina were of specific bridges including the rialto and the pont de neuilly and were subsequently rendered more generic the final designs still bear very close similarities to their specific prototypes thus they are not truly generic the monuments looked similar enough to different national monuments to please everyone 27 payments clearing electronic funds transfer edit main article single euro payments area capital within the eu may be transferred in any amount from one country to another all intra-eu transfers in euro are treated as domestic transactions and bear the corresponding domestic transfer costs 28 this includes all member states of the eu even those outside the eurozone providing the transactions are carried out in euro 29 credit debit card charging and atm withdrawals within the eurozone are also treated as domestic transactions however paper-based payment orders like cheques have not been standardised so these are still domestic-based the ecb has also set up a clearing system target for large euro transactions 30 currency sign edit the euro sign logotype and handwritten main article euro sign a special euro currency sign € was designed after a public survey had narrowed the original ten proposals down to two the european commission then chose the design created by the belgian alain billiet inspiration for the € symbol itself came from the greek epsilon Є note 18 – a reference to the cradle of european civilisation – and the first letter of the word europe crossed by two parallel lines to certify the stability of the euro — european commission 18 the european commission also specified a euro logo with exact proportions and foreground and background colour tones 31 while the commission intended the logo to be a prescribed glyph shape font designers made it clear that they intended to design their own variants instead 32 typewriters lacking the euro sign can create it by typing a capital c backspacing and overstriking it with the equal sign placement of the currency

euro was officially adopted in madrid on 16 december 1995 10 belgian esperantist germain pirlot a former teacher of french and history is credited with naming the new currency by sending a letter to then president of the european commission jacques santer suggesting the name euro on 4 august 1995 35 due to differences in national conventions for rounding and significant digits all conversion between the national currencies had to be carried out using the process of triangulation via the euro the definitive values of one euro in terms of the exchange rates at which the currency entered the euro are shown on the right the rates were determined by the council of the european union note 19 based on a recommendation from the european commission based on the market rates on 31 december 1998 they were set so that one european currency unit ecu would equal one euro the european currency unit was an accounting unit used by the eu based on the currencies of the member states it was not a currency in its own right they could not be set earlier because the ecu depended on the closing exchange rate of the non-euro currencies principally the pound sterling that day the procedure used to fix the conversion rate between the greek drachma and the euro was different since the euro by then was already two years old while the conversion rates for the initial eleven currencies were determined only hours before the euro was introduced the conversion rate for the greek drachma was fixed several months beforehand note 20 the currency was introduced in non-physical form traveller s cheques electronic transfers banking etc at midnight on 1 january 1999 when the national currencies of participating countries the eurozone ceased to exist independently their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other the euro thus became the successor to the european currency unit ecu the notes and coins for the old currencies however continued to be used as legal tender until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 january 2002 the changeover period during which the former currencies notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months until 28 february 2002 the official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state the earliest date was in germany where the mark officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 december 2001 though the exchange period lasted for two months more even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender they continued to be accepted by national central banks for periods ranging from several years to forever the latter in austria germany ireland estonia and latvia for banknotes and coins also belgium luxembourg slovenia and slovakia will accept banknotes forever but not coins the earliest coins to become non-convertible were the portuguese escudos which ceased to have monetary value after 31 december 2002 although banknotes remain exchangeable until 2022 eurozone crisis edit main articles eurozone crisis and greek government-debt crisis budget deficit of the euro area compared to the united states and the uk following the u.s financial crisis in 2008 fears of a sovereign debt crisis developed in 2009 among fiscally conservative investors concerning some european states with the situation becoming particularly tense in early 2010 36 37 this included eurozone members greece 38 ireland and portugal and also some eu countries outside the area 39 iceland the country which experienced the largest crisis in 2008 when its entire international banking system collapsed has emerged less affected by the sovereign-debt crisis as the government was unable to bail the banks out in the eu especially in countries where sovereign debts have increased sharply due to bank bailouts a crisis of confidence has emerged with the widening of bond yield spreads and risk insurance on credit default swaps between these countries and other eu members most importantly germany 40 41 to be included in the eurozone the countries had to fulfil certain convergence criteria but the meaningfulness of such criteria was diminished by the fact it was not enforced with the same degree of strictness from country to country 42 according to the economist intelligence unit in 2011 i f the euro area is treated as a single entity its economic and fiscal position looks no worse and in some respects rather better than that of the us or the uk and the budget deficit for the euro area as a whole is much lower and the euro area s government debt gdp ratio of 86 in 2010 was about the same level as that of the united states moreover they write private-sector indebtedness across the euro area as a whole is markedly lower than in the highly leveraged anglo-saxon economies the authors conclude that the crisis is as much political as economic and the result of the fact that the euro area lacks the support of institutional paraphernalia and mutual bonds of solidarity of a state 43 the crisis continued with s p downgrading nine euro-area countries including france then downgrading the entire european financial stability facility efsf fund citation needed in may 2012 socialist françois hollande was elected as president of france and a month later the french socialist legislative position was strengthened while german leader angela merkel has appeared to be floundering and been badly let down by her advisers in recent months one commentator said as such serious discord between french and german monetary decision-makers was comparable to that of 1992–93 at the height of the crisis over the european monetary system the forerunner to emu european monetary union h itherto relatively dormant signs of euro skepticism in german public opinion and throughout industry have been multiplying in recent months making hollande s proposals increasingly unpalatable to a broad swathe of german opinion although considerable controversy will continue to swirl over greece and spain the real battle lines over the future of the euro will be drawn up between germany and france the commentary concluded 44 another historical parallel – to 1931 when germany was burdened with debt unemployment and austerity while france and the united states were relatively strong creditors –

after the u.s dollar the share of the euro as a reserve currency has increased from 18 in 1999 to 27 in 2008 over this period the share of the u.s dollar fell from 71 to 64 and the yen fell from 6.4 to 3.3 the euro inherited and built on the status of the deutsche mark as the second most important reserve currency the euro remains underweight as a reserve currency in advanced economies while overweight in emerging and developing economies according to the international monetary fund 52 the total of euro held as a reserve in the world at the end of 2008 was equal to 1.1 trillion or €850 billion with a share of 22 of all currency reserves in advanced economies but a total of 31 of all currency reserves in emerging and developing economies the possibility of the euro becoming the first international reserve currency is now widely debated among economists 53 former us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan gave his opinion in september 2007 that it is absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the us dollar as reserve currency or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency 54 in contrast to greenspan s 2007 assessment the euro s increase in the share of the

geographical region in which it would maximise economic efficiency to have the entire region share a single currency there are two models both proposed by robert mundell the stationary expectations model and the international risk sharing model mundell himself advocates the international risk sharing model and thus concludes in favour of the euro 59 however even before the creation of the single currency there were concerns over diverging economies before the late-2000s recession the chances of a state leaving the euro or the chances that the whole zone would collapse were considered extremely slim 60 however the greek government-debt crisis led to former british foreign secretary jack straw claiming the eurozone could not last in its current form 61 part of the problem seems to be the rules that were created when the euro was set up john lanchester writing for the new yorker explains it thus the guiding principle of the currency which opened for business in 1999 were supposed to be a set of rules to limit a country s annual deficit to three per cent of gross domestic product and the total accumulated debt to sixty per cent of g.d.p it was a nice idea but by 2004

allowing businesses and individuals to consummate previously unprofitable trades for consumers banks in the eurozone must charge the same for intra-member cross-border transactions as purely domestic transactions for electronic payments e.g. credit cards debit cards and cash machine withdrawals the absence of distinct currencies also theoretically removes exchange rate risks although the imposition of transfer restrictions in 2012–13 cypriot financial crisis means that the situation is not quite so simple the risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their own currency zones companies that hedge against this risk will no longer need to shoulder this additional cost this is particularly important for countries whose currencies had traditionally fluctuated a great deal particularly the mediterranean nations citation needed financial markets on the continent are expected to be far more liquid and flexible than they were in the past the reduction in cross-border transaction costs will allow larger banking firms to provide a wider array of banking services that can compete across and beyond the eurozone however although transaction costs were reduced some studies have shown that risk aversion has increased during the last 40 years in the eurozone 64 price parity edit another effect of the common european currency is that differences in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because of the law of one price differences in prices can trigger arbitrage i.e. speculative trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential therefore prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets 65 macroeconomic stability edit low levels of inflation are the hallmark of stable and modern economies because a high level of inflation acts as a tax seigniorage and theoretically discourages investment it is generally viewed as undesirable in spite of the downside many countries have been unable or unwilling to deal with serious inflationary pressures some countries have successfully contained them by establishing largely independent central banks one such bank was the bundesbank in germany as the european central bank is modelled on the bundesbank 66 it is independent of the pressures of national governments and has a mandate to keep inflation low member countries that join the euro hope to enjoy the macroeconomic stability associated with low levels of inflation the ecb unlike the federal reserve in the united states of america does not have a second objective to sustain growth and employment many national and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have lower interest rates than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies while increased liquidity may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond denominating the bond in a currency with low levels of inflation arguably plays a much larger role a credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate unfortunately there is also a cost in structurally keeping inflation lower than in the united states uk and china the result is that seen from those countries the euro has become expensive making european products increasingly expensive for its largest importers hence export from the euro zone becomes more difficult this is one of the main reasons why economic growth inside the euro zone now lags behind growth in other large economies citation needed this effect is strongest in european countries with a weak economy in general those in europe who own large amounts of euros are served by high stability and low inflation those who now need to earn euros including those countries who need to pay interest on large debts are likely better served with a slightly less strong euro leading to more export because with a lower euro investors would see better chances for companies in southern european countries to grow themselves out of the crisis as a result investing there would become less risky and that would push interest rates for southern countries more in line with the european average citation needed the contradiction here is that high macroeconomic stability in the form of ongoing historically low inflation over time leads to economic problems creating higher interest rates and political and economic instability for the weaker partners citation needed trade edit a 2009 consensus from the studies of the introduction of the euro concluded that it has increased trade within the eurozone by 5 to 10 67 although one study suggested an increase of only 3 68 while another estimated 9 to 14 69 however a meta-analysis of all available studies suggests that the prevalence of positive estimates is caused by publication bias and that the underlying effect may be negligible 70 furthermore studies accounting for time trend reflecting general cohesion policies in europe that started before and continue after implementing the common currency find no effect on trade 71 72 these results suggest that other policies aimed at european integration might be the source of observed increase in trade investment edit physical investment seems to have increased by 5 in the eurozone due to the introduction 73 regarding foreign direct investment a study found that the intra-eurozone fdi stocks have increased by about 20 during the first four years of the emu 74 concerning the effect on corporate investment there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in europe the euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come from countries that previously had weak currencies a study found that the introduction of the euro accounts for 22 of the investment rate after 1998 in countries that previously had a weak currency 75 inflation edit the introduction of the euro has led to extensive discussion about its possible effect on inflation in the short term there was a widespread impression in the population of the eurozone that the introduction of the euro had led to an increase in prices but this impression was not confirmed by general indices of inflation and other studies 76 77 a study of this paradox found that this was due to an asymmetric effect of the introduction of the euro on prices while it had no effect on most goods it had an effect on cheap goods which have seen their price round up after the introduction of the euro the study found that consumers based their beliefs on inflation of those cheap goods which are frequently purchased 78 it has also been suggested that the jump in small prices may be because prior to the introduction retailers made fewer upward adjustments and waited for the introduction of the euro to do so 79 exchange rate risk edit one of the advantages of the adoption of a common currency is the reduction of the risk associated with changes in currency exchange rates it has been found that the introduction of the euro created significant reductions in market risk exposures for nonfinancial firms both in and outside of europe 80 these reductions in market risk were concentrated in firms domiciled in the eurozone and in non-euro firms with a high fraction of foreign sales or assets in europe financial integration edit the introduction of the euro seems to have had a strong effect on european financial integration according to a study on this question it has significantly reshaped the european financial system especially with respect to the securities markets however the real and policy barriers to integration in the retail and corporate banking sectors remain significant even if the wholesale end of banking has been largely integrated 81 specifically the euro has significantly decreased the cost of trade in bonds equity and banking assets within the eurozone 82 on a global level there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has led to an integration in terms of investment in bond portfolios with eurozone countries lending and borrowing more between each other than with other countries 83 effect on interest rates edit long-term interest rates of euro countries 1993–2016 as of january 2014 and since the introduction of the euro interest rates of most members countries particularly those with a weak currency have decreased the countries whose interest rates fell most as a result of the adoption of the euro are greece ireland portugal spain and italy these very countries have had the most serious sovereign financing problems the effect of declining interest rates combined with excess liquidity continually provided by the ecb made it easier for banks within the countries in which interest rates fell the most and their linked sovereigns to borrow significant amounts above the 3 of gdp budget deficit imposed on the eurozone initially and significantly inflate their public and private debt levels 84 following the late-2000s financial crisis governments in these countries found it necessary to bail out or nationalise their privately held banks to prevent systemic failure of the banking system when underlying hard or financial asset values were found to be grossly inflated and sometimes so near worthless there was no liquid market for them 85 this further increased the already high levels of public debt to a level the markets began to consider unsustainable via increasing government bond interest rates producing the ongoing european sovereign-debt crisis price convergence edit the evidence on the convergence of prices in the eurozone with the introduction of the euro is mixed several studies failed to find any evidence of convergence following the introduction of the euro after a phase of convergence in the early 1990s 86 87 other studies have found evidence of price convergence 88 89 in particular for cars 90 a possible reason for the divergence between the different studies is that the processes of convergence may not have been linear slowing down substantially between 2000 and 2003 and resurfacing after 2003 as suggested by a recent study 2009 91 tourism edit a study suggests that the introduction of the euro has had a positive effect on the amount of tourist travel within the emu with an increase of 6.5 92 exchange rates edit euro-us dollar exchange rate starting from 2002 more recent information is available here flexible exchange rates edit the ecb targets interest rates rather than exchange rates and in general does not intervene on the foreign exchange rate markets this is because of the implications of the mundell–fleming model which implies a central bank cannot without capital controls maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously because increasing the money supply results in a depreciation of the currency in the years following the single european act the eu has liberalised its capital markets and as the ecb has chosen monetary autonomy the exchange-rate regime of the euro is flexible or floating the result of the ecb maintaining historically low interest rates and restricting money supply has been that over the last decade the euro has become expensive relative to the currency of europe s main trading partners however in 2010 the euro started on a sharp decline starting at u.s 1.60 in 2008 and dropping to us 1.04 in 2015 the canadian dollar despite seeing a decline in value against the usd has seen a growth in euro cad against other major currencies edit the euro is the second-most widely held reserve currency after the u.s dollar after its introduction on 4 january 1999 its exchange rate against the other major currencies fell reaching its lowest exchange rates in 2000 25 october vs the u.s dollar 26 october vs japanese yen 3 may vs pound sterling afterwards it regained and its exchange rate reached its historical highest point in 2008 15 july vs u.s dollar 23 july vs japanese yen 29 december vs pound sterling with the advent of the global financial crisis the euro initially fell only to regain later despite pressure due to the european sovereign-debt crisis the euro remained stable 93 in november 2011 the euro s exchange rate index – measured against currencies of the bloc s major trading partners – was trading almost two percent higher on the year approximately at the same level as it was before the crisis kicked off in 2007 94 current and historical exchange rates against 29 other currencies european

alphabet as a result of bulgaria joining the european union in 2007 the formal titles of the currency are euro for the major unit and cent for the minor one hundredth unit and for official use in most eurozone languages according to the ecb all languages should use the same spelling for the nominative singular 98 this may contradict normal rules for word formation in some languages e.g. those where there is no eu diphthong bulgaria has negotiated an exception euro in the bulgarian cyrillic alphabet is spelled as eвро evro and not eуро euro in all official documents 99 in the greek script the term ευρώ evró is used the greek cent coins are denominated in λεπτό ά leptó á official practice for english-language eu legislation is to use the words euro and cent as both singular and plural 100 although the european commission s directorate-general for translation states that the plural forms euros and cents should be used in english 101 criticism edit unemployment edit nobel memorial prize-winning economist james meade thought that a central bank should not make price stability the objective of aggregate demand management when prices are likely to be pushed up due to increase of indirect taxes or adverse terms-of-trade shocks the surge in prices must be cancelled out by decline in domestic money wage costs as long as such a price stability policy is adopted 102 there would be unemployment in the all industrial sectors under a price stabilisation policy suggesting that in the short run the elasticity of demand for labour is low under the ecb s price stabilisation policy many people in the eurozone have difficulty finding a job the unemployment rate of spain is around 25 percent in 2014 and an economic forecast says that the figure will not decrease below 20 percent until 2017 103 elstat the statistics agency of greece shows that greece s unemployment rate was 27 percent in june 2014 104 oecd forecasts that greece s unemployment rate will remain around 27 percent until 2016 due to long-term unemployment skills of jobless persons have been depreciated and their motivation of finding jobs has been lost which causes the country s level of unemployment to remain high 105 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 5 10 15 20 25 30 portugal spain italy greece eurozone average finland ireland germany jobless 106 persons thousands 4q 2013 unemployment rate 4q 2013 106 spain s youth unemployment rate is 53.8 percent in july 2014 and this is the highest figure in the eurozone 107 this figure is comparable to 53.1 percent of the greek youth unemployment in may 2014 in july 2014 the averaged unemployment rate of the eurozone is 11.7 percent slight decrease from 11.9 percent in 2013 106 107 likewise paul krugman argued that the existence of a single shared currency across the entire eurozone in combination with tight money policies of the ecb motivated by insistence of germany on low inflation placed much of southern europe in a state of permanent high unemployment according to krugman during the period between the creation of the euro and the 2008 financial crisis countries of southern europe experienced abnormally high rates of wage growth due to high influx of investor money between 2000 and 2008 unit labor costs actually declined slightly in germany but rose by 30 in spain and greece 108 this created an imbalance that put these countries at competitive disadvantage relative to northern europe returning to full employment at this point requires that the labor costs gap is somehow cancelled if spain and greece had their own currencies this would have easily happened through exchange rate adjustment since they don t it can either happen through a decrease in nominal wages in spain and greece also known as internal devaluation an extremely difficult and slow process since nominal wages in general exhibit downward rigidity or through an equal increase in nominal wages i.e inflation in northern europe which does not happen because of active resistance from germany 109 110
