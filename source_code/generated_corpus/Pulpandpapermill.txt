pulp and paper manufacture involves a great deal of humidity which presents a preventive maintenance and corrosion challenge a paper mill is a factory devoted to making paper from vegetable fibres such as wood pulp old rags and other ingredients using a fourdrinier machine or other type of paper machine history edit see also history of paper a mid-19th century paper mill the forest fibre company in berlin new hampshire historical investigations into the origin of the paper mill are complicated by differing definitions and loose terminology from modern authors many modern scholars use the term to refer indiscriminately to all kinds of mills whether powered by humans by animals or by water their propensity to refer to any ancient paper manufacturing centre as a mill without further specifying its exact power drive has increased the difficulty of identifying the particularly efficient and historically important water-powered type 1 human and animal-powered mills edit while the use of human and animal powered mills was known to chinese and muslim papermakers evidence for water-powered paper mills is elusive in both of them 2 3 4 5 the general absence of the use of water-power in muslim papermaking is suggested by the habit of muslim authors to call a production center not a mill but a paper manufactory 6 although scholars have identified paper mills in abbasid era baghdad in 794–795 the evidence that waterpower was applied to papermaking at this time is a matter of scholarly debate 7 in the moroccan city of fez ibn battuta speaks of 400 mill stones for paper 8 since ibn battuta does not mention the use of water-power and such a number of water-mills would be grotesquely high the passage is generally taken to refer to human or animal force 4 8 water-powered mills edit dutch paper mill from 1654 in the arnhem open-air museum stromer s paper mill the building complex at the far right bottom in the nuremberg chronicle of 1493 due to their noise and smell papermills were required by medieval law to be erected some distance from the city walls an exhaustive survey of milling in al-andalus did not uncover a single water-powered paper mill nor do the spanish books of property distribution repartimientos after the christian reconquest refer to any 9 arabic texts never use the term mill in connection with papermaking and the most thorough account of muslim papermaking the one by the zirid sultan al-muizz ibn badis describes the art purely in terms of a handcraft 9 donald hill has identified a possible reference to a water-powered paper mill in samarkand in the 11th-century work of the persian scholar abu rayhan biruni but concludes that the passage is too brief to enable us to say with certainty that it refers to a water-powered paper mill 10 11 while this is seen by halevi nonetheless as evidence of samarkand first harnessing waterpower in the production of paper he concedes that it is not known if waterpower was applied to papermaking elsewhere across the islamic world at the time 12 robert i burns remains altogether sceptical given the isolated occurrence of the reference and the prevalence of manual labour in islamic papermaking elsewhere 1 hill notes that paper mills appear in early christian catalonian documentation from the 1150s which may imply islamic origins but here too hard evidence is lacking 13 14 and the case for early catalan water-powered paper mills has been thoroughly dismissed after a re-examination of the evidence cited by burns 15 likewise the identification of early hydraulic stamping mills in medieval documents from fabriano italy is completely without substance 16 the earliest certain evidence to a water-powered paper mill dates to 1282 in the spanish kingdom of aragon 17 a decree by the christian king peter iii addresses the establishment of a royal molendinum a proper hydraulic mill in the paper manufacturing centre of xàtiva 17 the crown innovation appears to be resented by the local muslim papermakering community the document guarantees the muslim subjects the right to continue their way of traditional papermaking by beating the pulp manually and grants them the right to be exempted from work in the new mill 17 the first permanent paper mill north of the alps was established in nuremberg by ulman stromer in 1390 it is later depicted in the lavishly illustrated nuremberg chronicle 18 from the mid-14th century onwards european paper milling underwent a rapid improvement of many work processes 19 20th century edit by the early 20th century paper mills sprang up around new england and the rest of the world due to the high demand for paper at this time there were many world leaders of the production of paper one of such was the brown company in berlin new hampshire run by william wentworth brown during the year 1907 the brown company cut between 30 and 40 million acres of woodlands on their property 20 which extended from la tuque quebec canada to west palm florida 21 “ log drives ” were conducted on local rivers to send the logs to the mills by the late 20th and early 21st-century paper mills began to close and the log drives became a dying craft 22 due to the addition of new machinery many millworkers were laid off and many of the historic paper mills closed 23 characteristics edit main articles pulp mill and paper machine paper mills can be fully integrated mills or nonintegrated mills integrated mills consist of a pulp mill and a paper mill on the same site such mills receive logs or wood chips and produce paper the modern paper mill uses large amounts of energy water and wood pulp in an efficient and complex series of processes and control technology to produce a sheet of paper that can be used in diverse ways modern paper machines can be 500 feet 150 m in length produce a sheet 400 inches 10 m wide and operate at speeds of more than 60 miles per hour 97 km h 24 the two main suppliers of paper machines are metso
