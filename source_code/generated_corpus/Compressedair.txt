a pressure that is greater than atmospheric pressure it serves many domestic and industrial purposes in europe 10 percent of all industrial electricity consumption is to produce compressed airâ€”amounting to 80 terawatt hours consumption per year 1 2 uses edit air compressor station in a power plant in industry compressed air is so widely used that it is often regarded as the fourth utility after electricity natural gas and water however compressed air is more expensive than the other three utilities when evaluated on a per unit energy delivered basis 3 compressed air is used for many purposes including pneumatics the use of pressurized gases to do work pneumatic post using capsules to move paper and small goods through tubes air tools hvac control systems vehicle propulsion see compressed air vehicle energy storage see compressed air energy storage air brakes including railway braking systems road vehicle braking systems scuba diving for breathing and to inflate buoyancy devices refrigeration using a vortex tube air-start systems in engines ammunition propulsion in air guns airsoft equipment paintball equipment cleaning dust and small debris in tiny spaces the header piping up to the air dryers is exposed to moist hot air temperatures can reach well over 150 degrees f copper stainless steel and other piping materials that are less corrosive are recommended if plain carbon steel piping is installed then rust particles can pass downstream and interfere with the operation of condensate valves and wye strainers the riser piping should connect to the top of the header piping and be one pipe size larger than the compressor discharge piping and or overhead header piping a drip leg with a drain is needed to prevent water from flowing back to the compressor mount valves in the highest horizontal piping this avoids the hazard of opening a closed valve in vertical piping and releasing trapped condensate to flow back into air compressors all of the header main compressed air piping should slope 1 8 to 1 4 per foot down and away from the point of origin gravity and airflow will then carry condensate to the low points where a drop leg should be installed to allow for removal at accessible drop legs and drain points these drops should be installed every 50 to 70 feet in the system and be taken from the bottom of the main line to insure as much removal as possible the inlet piping for air dryers should connect to the bottom of the piping headers compressed air rooms with multiple air compressors edit where multiple air compressors are to connect the riser piping to the top of overhead piping headers the inlet piping for air dryer s should connect to the bottom of the piping headers compressed air distribution piping outside air compressors rooms edit all of the header main compressed air piping should slope 1 8 per foot down from the point of origin gravity and airflow will then carry condensate to the low points where drop leg should be installed to allow for removal at to accessible drop legs and drain points for larger plant as the piping elevation lowers a full size tee with a bottom drip leg preceding an elbow turned up to raise the pipe elevation these drip legs up turned elbows are typically 200 to 300 feet apart i.e the main piping slopes about 1 100 feet and the elbow up raises the piping elevation 2 to 3 feet compressed air should flow through the straight ends of a tee and should never hit the back side of a tee compressed air piping drops edit the air piping drops should connect from the top of the main piping this prevents any condensate which forms in the main piping from flowing into the branch pipes individual shut-off valves should be installed in the horizontal section of the connection piping above the main piping at each drop pipe to isolate it from the rest of the system for maintenance compressed air velocity in piping and fittings edit pressure drop is proportional to the square of the velocity any high-volume intermittent demand produces dramatic pressure drop during peak periods 4 type velocity application fittings tee 20 ft second dead head tee flow enters through side inlet of the tee or use angled entry fittings to avoid flowing compressed air into dead head tee 5 fittings elbows 20 ft second always use long radius elbows straight piping plant distribution air mains 20 ft second all pipeline velocities to be 20 fps or less at 100 psig. 6 7 8 straight piping compressor room 20 ft second compressor room piping straight piping drops 40 ft second drops up to 10 feet long from mains to machinery straight piping moisture removal 20 ft second to collect moisture drains at low points 9
