4-seater sports 1937 founding aston martin was founded in 1913 by lionel martin and robert bamford 9 the two had joined forces as bamford martin the previous year to sell cars made by singer from premises in callow street london where they also serviced gwk and calthorpe vehicles martin raced specials at aston hill near aston clinton and the pair decided to make their own vehicles 10 the first car to be named aston martin was created by martin by fitting a four-cylinder coventry-simplex engine to the chassis of a 1908 isotta-fraschini 11 12 they acquired premises at henniker mews 13 in kensington and produced their first car in march 1915 production could not start because of the outbreak of world war i and martin joined the admiralty and bamford the royal army service corps all machinery was sold to the sopwith aviation company inter war years after the war the company was refounded at abingdon road kensington and a new car designed to carry the aston-martin name bamford left in 1920 and the company was revitalised with funding from count louis zborowski in 1922 bamford martin produced cars to compete in the french grand prix which went on to set world speed and endurance records at brooklands three works team cars with 16-valve twin cam engines were built for racing and record breaking chassis number 1914 later developed as the green pea chassis number 1915 the razor blade record car and chassis number 1916 later developed as the halford special approximately 55 cars were built for sale in two configurations long chassis and short chassis the company went bankrupt in 1924 and was bought by lady charnwood who put her son john benson on the board the company failed again in 1925 and the factory closed in 1926 with lionel martin leaving later that year bill renwick augustus bert bertelli and investors which included lady charnwood took control of the company they renamed it aston martin motors and moved it to the former whitehead aircraft limited works in feltham renwick and bertelli had been in partnership some years and had developed an overhead-cam four-cylinder engine using renwick s patented combustion chamber design which they had tested in an enfield-allday chassis the only renwick and bertelli motor car made it was known as buzzbox and still survives the pair had planned to sell their engine to motor manufacturers but having heard that the aston martin was no longer in production realised they could capitalise on its reputation to jump start the production of a completely new car between 1926 and 1937 bertelli was both technical director and designer of all new aston martins since known as bertelli cars they included the 1½-litre t-type international le mans mkii and its racing derivative the ulster and the 2-litre 15 98 and its racing derivative the speed model most were open two-seater sports cars bodied by bert bertelli s brother enrico harry with a small number of long-chassis four-seater tourers dropheads and saloons also produced bertelli was a competent driver keen to race his cars one of few owner manufacturer drivers the lm team cars were very successful in national and international motor racing including at le mans and the mille miglia financial problems reappeared in 1932 the company was rescued for a year by l prideaux brune before passing it on to sir arthur sutherland in 1936 aston martin decided to concentrate on road cars producing just 700 until world war ii halted work production shifted to aircraft components during the war david brown era 1958 aston martin db mark iii in 1947 tractor manufacturer david brown limited bought the company under the leadership of managing director sir david brown —its post-war saviour the company also acquired lagonda that year for its 2.6-litre w o bentley designed engine both companies shared resources and workshops leading to the classic db series of cars in 1950 the company announced the db2 followed by the db2 4 in 1953 the db2 4 mkii in 1955 the db mark iii in 1957 and the italian-styled 3.7 l db4 in 1958 while these models helped aston martin establish a good racing pedigree the db4 stood out and yielded the famous db5 in 1963 the company stayed true to its emerging grand touring style with the db6 1965–70 and dbs 1967–1972 the six-cylinder engines of these cars from 1954 up to 1965 were designed by tadek marek 1970s—changing ownership the aston martin company was often financially troubled in 1972 the firm was sold to company developments a birmingham based consortium chaired by william wilson mbe 14 the company was resold in 1975 by its receiver following a further bankruptcy to north american businessmen peter sprague and george minden for £1.05 million 15 a successful turn-around strategy led to the recruitment of 360 new employees and by 1977 a trading profit of £750,000 15 the new owners pushed the company into modernising its line producing the v8 vantage in 1977 the convertible volante in 1978 and the one-off william towns styled bulldog in 1980 towns also styled the futuristic new lagonda saloon based on the v8 model in 1980 aston-martin sought to buy mg planning to design a new model and offering their take on an updated 1981 model mgb the acquisition never developed as the company was badly hit by the economic contraction of the early 1980s worldwide sales shrank to three cars per week prompting chairman alan curtis sprague and minden to consider shutting down production to concentrate on service and restoration at this point curtis attended the 1980 pace sponsored stirling moss benefit day at brands hatch and met fellow farnham resident victor gauntlett 1980s—victor gauntlett gauntlett bought a 12.5 stake in aston martin for £500,000 via pace petroleum in 1980 with tim hearley of ch industrials taking a similar share pace and chi took over as joint 50 50 owners at the beginning of 1981 with gauntlett as executive chairman gauntlett also led the sales team and after some development and publicity when it became the world s fastest 4-seater production car was able to sell the aston martin lagonda in oman kuwait and qatar 16 in 1982 aston martin was granted a royal warrant of appointment by the prince of wales citation needed the company holds the warrant to this day understanding that it would take some time to develop new aston martin products they created an engineering service subsidiary to develop automotive products for other companies it was decided to use the name of the coachbuilding company tickford which aston martin had owned since 1955 the name being already associated with quality cars in the public perception products included a tickford austin metro a tickford ford capri and even tickford train interiors particularly on the jaguar xjs 16 pace continued sponsoring racing events and now sponsored all aston martin owners club events taking a tickford-engined nimrod group c car owned by amoc president viscount downe which came third in the manufacturers championship in both 1982 and 1983 it also finished seventh in the 1982 24 hours of le mans race however sales of production cars were now at an all-time low of 30 cars produced in 1982 16 as trading became tighter in the petroleum market and aston martin was requiring more time and money gauntlett agreed to sell hays pace to the kuwait investment office in september 1983 as aston martin required greater investment he also agreed to sell his share holding to american importer and greek shipping tycoon peter livanos who invested via his joint venture company with nick and john papanicolaou all inc gauntlett remained chairman of the aml company 55 owned by all with tickford a 50 50 venture between all and chi the uneasy relationship was ended when all exercised options to buy a larger share in aml chi s residual shares were exchanged for chi s complete ownership of tickford which retained development of existing aston martin projects in 1984 titan the main shipping company of the papanicolaou s was in trouble so livanos s father george bought out the papanicolaou s shares in all while gauntlett again became a shareholder with a 25 holding in aml the deal valued aston martin aml at £2 million the year it built its 10,000th car 16 although as a result aston martin had to make 60 members of the workforce redundant gauntlett bought a stake in italian styling house zagato and resurrected its collaboration with aston martin aston martin v8 vantage from the living daylights in 1986 gauntlett negotiated the return of fictional british secret agent james bond to aston martin cubby broccoli had chosen to recast the character using actor timothy dalton in an attempt to re-root the bond-brand back to a more sean connery like feel gauntlett supplied his personal pre-production vantage for use in the filming of the living daylights and sold a volante to broccoli for use at his home in america gauntlett turned down the role of a kgb colonel in the film however i would have loved to have done it but really could not afford the time 17 the company needed funds to survive in the long term in may 1987 gauntlett and prince michael of kent were staying at the home of contessa maggi the wife of the founder of the original mille miglia while watching the revival event another house guest was walter hayes vice-president of ford of europe despite problems over the previous acquisition of ac cars hayes saw the potential of the brand and the discussion resulted in ford taking a share holding in september 1987 18 in 1988 having produced some 5,000 cars in 20 years a revived economy and successful sales of limited edition vantage and 52 volante zagato coupes at £86,000 each the company finally retired the ancient v8 and introduced the virage range—the first new aston launched in 20 years although gauntlett was contractually to stay as chairman for two years his racing interests took aston back into sports car racing in 1989 with limited european success however with engine rule changes for the 1990 season and the launch of the new aston martin volante model ford provided the limited supply of cosworth engines to the jaguar cars racing team as the small aston db7 would require a large engineering input ford agreed to take full control of aston martin and gauntlett handed over the company chairmanship to hayes in 1991 19 in 1992 the vantage version was announced and the following year the company renewed the db range by announcing the db7 ford era ford placed aston in the premier automotive group invested in new manufacturing and ramped up production in 1994 ford opened a new factory at banbury road in bloxham in 1995 the company produced a record 700 vehicles until the ford era cars had been produced by hand coachbuilding craft methods such as the english wheel in 1998 the 2,000th db7 was built and in 2002 the 6,000th exceeding production of all previous db models the db7 range was boosted by the addition of v12 vantage models in 1999 and in 2001 the company introduced the v12-engined aston martin vanquish at the north american international auto show in detroit michigan in 2003 aston martin introduced the amv8 vantage concept car expected to have few changes before its introduction in 2005 the vantage brought back the classic v8 engine to allow the company to compete in a larger market 2003 also saw the opening of the gaydon factory the first purpose-built factory in aston martin s history also introduced in 2003 was the db9 coupé which replaced the ten-year-old db7 a convertible version of the db9

niehl cologne plant with capacity to produce up to 5,000 engines a year by 100 specially trained personnel like traditional aston martin engine production from newport pagnell assembly of each unit is entrusted to a single technician from a pool of 30 with v8 and v12 variants assembled in under 20 hours by bringing engine production back to within the company the promise was that aston martin would be able to produce small runs of higher performance variants engines 20 this expanded engine capacity allowed in 2006 the v8 vantage sports car to enter production at the gaydon factory joining the db9 and db9 volante in december 2003 aston martin announced it would return to motor racing in 2005 a new division was created called aston martin racing which became responsible together with
