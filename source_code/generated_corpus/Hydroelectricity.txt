development portal renewable energy portal environment portal v t e hydroelectricity is electricity produced from hydropower in 2015 hydropower generated 16.6 of the world s total electricity and 70 of all renewable electricity 1 and was expected to increase about 3.1 each year for the next 25 years hydropower is produced in 150 countries with the asia-pacific region generating 33 percent of global hydropower in 2013 china is the largest hydroelectricity producer with 920 twh of production in 2013 representing 16.9 percent of domestic electricity use the cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low making it a competitive source of renewable electricity the hydro station consumes no water unlike coal or gas plants the average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 u.s cents per kilowatt-hour 2 with a dam and reservoir it is also a flexible source of electricity since the amount produced by the station can be changed up or down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands once a hydroelectric complex is constructed the project produces no direct waste and has a considerably lower output level of greenhouse gases than fossil fuel powered energy plants 3 history see also hydropower § history museum hydroelectric power plant ″under the town″ in serbia built in 1900 4 5 hydropower has been used since ancient times to grind flour and perform other tasks in the mid-1770s french engineer bernard forest de bélidor published architecture hydraulique which described vertical and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines by the late 19th century the electrical generator was developed and could now be coupled with hydraulics 6 the growing demand for the industrial revolution would drive development as well 7 in 1878 the world s first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at cragside in northumberland england by william george armstrong it was used to power a single arc lamp in his art gallery 8 the old schoelkopf power station no 1 near niagara falls in the u.s side began to produce electricity in 1881 the first edison hydroelectric power station the vulcan street plant began operating september 30 1882 in appleton wisconsin with an output of about 12.5 kilowatts 9 by 1886 there were 45 hydroelectric power stations in the u.s and canada by 1889 there were 200 in the u.s alone 6 at the beginning of the 20th century many small hydroelectric power stations were being constructed by commercial companies in mountains near metropolitan areas grenoble france held the international exhibition of hydropower and tourism with over one million visitors by 1920 as 40 of the power produced in the united states was hydroelectric the federal power act was enacted into law the act created the federal power commission to regulate hydroelectric power stations on federal land and water as the power stations became larger their associated dams developed additional purposes to include flood control irrigation and navigation federal funding became necessary for large-scale development and federally owned corporations such as the tennessee valley authority 1933 and the bonneville power administration 1937 were created 7 additionally the bureau of reclamation which had begun a series of western u.s irrigation projects in the early 20th century was now constructing large hydroelectric projects such as the 1928 hoover dam 10 the u.s army corps of engineers was also involved in hydroelectric development completing the bonneville dam in 1937 and being recognized by the flood control act of 1936 as the premier federal flood control agency 11 hydroelectric power stations continued to become larger throughout the 20th century hydropower was referred to as white coal for its power and plenty 12 hoover dam s initial 1,345 mw power station was the world s largest hydroelectric power station in 1936 it was eclipsed by the 6809 mw grand coulee dam in 1942 13 the itaipu dam opened in 1984 in south america as the largest producing 14,000 mw but was surpassed in 2008 by the three gorges dam in china at 22,500 mw hydroelectricity would eventually supply some countries including norway democratic republic of the congo paraguay and brazil with over 85 of their electricity the united states currently has over 2,000 hydroelectric power stations that supply 6.4 of its total electrical production output which is 49 of its renewable electricity 7 generating methods turbine row at el nihuil ii power station in mendoza argentina cross section of a conventional hydroelectric dam a typical turbine and generator conventional dams see also list of conventional hydroelectric power stations most hydroelectric power comes from the potential energy of dammed water driving a water turbine and generator the power extracted from the water depends on the volume and on the difference in height between the source and the water s outflow this height difference is called the head a large pipe the penstock delivers water from the reservoir to the turbine 14 pumped-storage main article pumped-storage hydroelectricity see also list of pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations this method produces electricity to supply high peak demands by moving water between reservoirs at different elevations at times of low electrical demand the excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the higher reservoir when the demand becomes greater water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine pumped-storage schemes currently provide the most commercially important means of large-scale grid energy storage and improve the daily capacity factor of the generation system pumped storage is not an energy source and appears as a negative number in listings 15 run-of-the-river main article run-of-the-river hydroelectricity see also list of run-of-the-river hydroelectric power stations run-of-the-river hydroelectric stations are those with small or no reservoir capacity so that only the water coming from upstream is available for generation at that moment and any oversupply must pass unused a constant supply of water from a lake or existing reservoir upstream is a significant advantage in choosing sites for run-of-the-river in the united states run of the river hydropower could potentially provide 60,000 megawatts 80,000,000 hp about 13.7 of total use in 2011 if continuously available 16 tide main article tide power see also list of tidal power stations a tidal power station makes use of the daily rise and fall of ocean water due to tides such sources are highly predictable and if conditions permit construction of reservoirs can also be dispatchable to generate power during high demand periods less common types of hydro schemes use water s kinetic energy or undammed sources such as undershot water wheels tidal power is viable in a relatively small number of locations around the world in great britain there are eight sites that could be developed which have the potential to generate 20 of the electricity used in 2012 17 sizes types and capacities of hydroelectric facilities large facilities see also list of largest power stations in the world and list of largest hydroelectric power stations large-scale hydroelectric power stations are more commonly seen as the largest power producing facilities in the world with some hydroelectric facilities capable of generating more than double the installed capacities of the current largest nuclear power stations although no official definition exists for the capacity range of large hydroelectric power stations facilities from over a few hundred megawatts are generally considered large hydroelectric facilities currently only four facilities over 10 gw

small hydro small hydro is the development of hydroelectric power on a scale serving a small community or industrial plant the definition of a small hydro project varies but a generating capacity of up to 10 megawatts mw is generally accepted as the upper limit of what can be termed small hydro this may be stretched to 25 mw and 30 mw in canada and the united states small-scale hydroelectricity production grew by 28 during 2008 from 2005 raising the total world small-hydro capacity to 85 gw over 70 of this was in china 65 gw followed by japan 3.5 gw the united states 3 gw and india 2 gw 19 a micro-hydro facility in vietnam pico hydroelectricity in mondulkiri cambodia small hydro stations may be connected to conventional electrical distribution networks as a source of low-cost renewable energy alternatively small hydro projects may be built in isolated areas that would be uneconomic to serve from a network or in areas where there is no national electrical distribution network since small hydro projects usually have minimal reservoirs and civil construction work they are seen as having a relatively low environmental impact compared to large hydro this decreased environmental impact depends strongly on the balance between stream flow and power production micro main article micro hydro micro hydro is a term used for hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to 100 kw of power these installations can provide power to an isolated home or small community or are sometimes connected to electric power networks there are many of these installations around the world particularly in developing nations as they can provide an economical source of energy without purchase of fuel 20 micro hydro systems complement photovoltaic solar energy systems because in many areas water flow and thus available hydro power is highest in the winter when solar energy is at a minimum pico main article pico hydro pico hydro is a term used for hydroelectric power generation of under 5 kw it is useful in small remote communities that require only a small amount of electricity for example to power one or two fluorescent light bulbs and a tv or radio for a few homes 21 even smaller turbines of 200-300w may power a single home in a developing country with a drop of only 1 m 3 ft a pico-hydro setup is typically run-of-the-river meaning that dams are not used but rather pipes divert some of the flow drop this down a gradient and through the turbine before returning it to the stream underground main article underground power station an underground power station is generally used at large facilities and makes use of a large natural height difference between two waterways such as a waterfall or mountain lake an underground tunnel is constructed to take water from the high reservoir to the generating hall built in an underground cavern near the lowest point of the water tunnel and a horizontal tailrace taking water away to the lower outlet waterway measurement of the tailrace and forebay rates at the limestone generating station in manitoba canada calculating available power main article hydropower a simple formula for approximating electric power production at a hydroelectric station is p ρ h r g k \displaystyle p \rho hrgk where p \displaystyle p is power in watts ρ \displaystyle \rho is the density of water 1000 kg m 3 h \displaystyle h is height in meters r \displaystyle r is flow rate in cubic meters per second g \displaystyle g is acceleration due to gravity of 9.8 m s 2 k \displaystyle k is a coefficient of efficiency ranging from 0 to 1 efficiency is often higher that is closer to 1 with larger and more modern turbines annual electric energy production depends on the available water supply in some installations the water flow rate can vary by a factor of 10 1 over the course of a year properties advantages the ffestiniog power station can generate 360 mw of electricity within 60 seconds of the demand arising flexibility hydropower is a flexible source of electricity since stations can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands 2 hydro turbines have a start-up time of the order of a few minutes 22 it takes around 60 to 90 seconds to bring a unit from cold start-up to full load this is much shorter than for gas turbines or steam plants 23 power generation can also be decreased quickly when there is a surplus power generation 24 hence the limited capacity of hydropower units is not generally used to produce base power except for vacating the flood pool or meeting downstream needs 25 instead it serves as backup for non-hydro generators 24 low power costs the major advantage of hydroelectricity is elimination of the cost of fuel the cost of operating a hydroelectric station is nearly immune to increases in the cost of fossil fuels such as oil natural gas or coal and no imports are needed the average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 u.s cents per kilowatt-hour 2 hydroelectric stations have long economic lives with some plants still in service after 50–100 years 26 operating labor cost is also usually low as plants are automated and have few personnel on site during normal operation where a dam serves multiple purposes a hydroelectric station may be added with relatively low construction cost providing a useful revenue stream to offset the costs of dam operation it has been calculated that the sale of electricity from the three gorges dam will cover the construction costs after 5 to 8 years of full generation 27 additionally some data shows that in most countries large hydropower dams will be too costly and take too long to build to deliver a positive risk adjusted return unless appropriate risk management measures are put in place 28 suitability for industrial applications while many hydroelectric projects supply public electricity networks some are created to serve specific industrial enterprises dedicated hydroelectric projects are often built to provide the substantial amounts of electricity needed for aluminium electrolytic plants for example the grand coulee dam switched to support alcoa aluminium in bellingham washington united states for american world war ii airplanes before it was allowed to provide irrigation and power to citizens in addition to aluminium power after the war in suriname the brokopondo reservoir was constructed to provide electricity for the alcoa aluminium industry new zealand s manapouri power station was constructed to supply electricity to the aluminium smelter at tiwai point reduced co 2 emissions since hydroelectric dams do not burn fossil fuels they do not directly produce carbon dioxide while some carbon dioxide is produced during manufacture and construction of the project this is a tiny fraction of the operating emissions of equivalent fossil-fuel electricity generation one measurement of greenhouse gas related and other externality comparison between energy sources can be found in the externe project by the paul scherrer institute and the university of stuttgart which was funded by the european commission 29 according to that study hydroelectricity produces the least amount of greenhouse gases and externality of any energy source 30 coming in second place was wind third was nuclear energy and fourth was solar photovoltaic 30 the low greenhouse gas impact of hydroelectricity is found especially in temperate climates the above study was for local energy in europe presumably similar conditions prevail in north america and northern asia which all see a regular natural freeze thaw cycle with associated seasonal plant decay and regrowth greater greenhouse gas emission impacts are found in the tropical regions because the reservoirs of power stations in tropical regions produce a larger amount of methane than those in temperate areas 31 other uses of the reservoir reservoirs created by hydroelectric schemes often provide facilities for water sports and become tourist attractions themselves in some countries aquaculture in reservoirs is common multi-use dams installed for irrigation support agriculture with a relatively constant water supply large hydro dams can control floods which would otherwise affect people living downstream of the project 32 disadvantages see also renewable energy debate § disadvantages of hydroelectricity ecosystem damage and loss of land hydroelectric power stations that use dams would submerge large areas of land due to the requirement of a reservoir merowe dam in sudan large reservoirs associated with traditional hydroelectric power stations result in submersion of extensive areas upstream of the dams sometimes destroying biologically rich and productive lowland and riverine valley forests marshland and grasslands damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife 2 the loss of land is often exacerbated by habitat fragmentation of surrounding areas caused by the reservoir 33 hydroelectric projects can be disruptive to surrounding aquatic ecosystems both upstream and downstream of the plant site generation of hydroelectric power changes the downstream river environment water exiting a turbine usually contains very little suspended sediment which can lead to scouring of river beds and loss of riverbanks 34 since turbine gates are often opened intermittently rapid or even daily fluctuations in river flow are observed siltation and flow shortage when water flows it has the ability to transport particles heavier than itself downstream this has a negative effect on dams and subsequently their power stations particularly those on rivers or within catchment areas with high siltation siltation can fill a reservoir and reduce its capacity to control floods along with causing additional horizontal pressure on the upstream portion of the dam eventually some reservoirs can become full of sediment and useless or over-top during a flood and fail 35 36 changes in the amount of river flow will correlate with the amount of energy produced by a dam lower river flows will reduce the amount of live storage in a reservoir therefore reducing the amount of water that can be used for hydroelectricity the result of diminished river flow can be power shortages in areas that depend heavily on hydroelectric power the risk of flow shortage may increase as a result of climate change 37 one study from the colorado river in the united states suggest that modest climate changes such as an increase in temperature in 2 degree celsius resulting in a 10 decline in precipitation might reduce river run-off by up to 40 37 brazil in particular is vulnerable due to its heavy reliance on hydroelectricity as increasing temperatures lower water ﬂow and alterations in the rainfall regime could reduce total energy production by 7 annually by the end of the century 37 methane emissions from reservoirs the hoover dam in the united states is a large conventional dammed-hydro facility with an installed capacity of 2,080 mw see also environmental impacts of reservoirs lower positive impacts are found in the tropical regions as it has been noted that the reservoirs of power plants in tropical regions produce substantial amounts of methane this is due to plant material in flooded areas decaying in an anaerobic environment and forming methane a greenhouse gas according to the world commission on dams report 38 where the reservoir is large compared to the generating capacity less than 100 watts per square metre of surface area and no clearing of the forests in the area was undertaken prior to impoundment of the reservoir greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoir may be higher than those of a conventional oil-fired thermal generation plant 39 in boreal reservoirs of canada and northern europe however greenhouse gas emissions are typically only 2 to 8 of any kind of conventional fossil-fuel thermal generation a new class of underwater logging operation that targets drowned forests can mitigate the effect of forest decay 40 relocation another disadvantage of hydroelectric dams is the need to relocate the people living where the reservoirs are planned in 2000 the world commission on dams estimated that dams had physically displaced 40-80 million people worldwide 41 failure risks see also dam failure and list of hydroelectric power station failures because large conventional dammed-hydro facilities hold back large volumes of water a failure due to poor construction natural disasters or sabotage can be catastrophic to downriver settlements and infrastructure during typhoon nina in 1975 banqiao dam failed in southern china when more than a year s worth of rain fell within 24 hours the resulting flood resulted in the deaths of 26,000 people and another 145,000 from epidemics millions were left homeless the creation of a dam in a geologically inappropriate location may cause disasters such as 1963 disaster at vajont dam in italy where almost 2,000 people died 42 the malpasset dam failure in fréjus on the french riviera côte d azur southern france collapsed on december 2 1959 killing 423 people in the resulting flood 43 smaller dams and micro hydro facilities create less risk but can form continuing hazards even after being decommissioned for example the small kelly barnes dam failed in 1977 causing 39 deaths with the toccoa flood twenty years after its power station was decommissioned the earthen embankment dam failed 44 comparison with other methods of power generation hydroelectricity eliminates the flue gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion including pollutants such as sulfur dioxide nitric oxide carbon monoxide dust and mercury in the coal hydroelectricity also avoids the hazards of coal mining and the indirect health effects of coal emissions compared to nuclear power hydroelectricity construction requires altering large areas of the environment while a nuclear power station has a small footprint and hydro-powerstation failures have caused tens of thousands of more deaths than any nuclear station failure 33 42 44 the creation of garrison dam for example required native american land to create lake sakakawea which has a shoreline of 1,320 miles and caused the inhabitants to sell 94 of their arable land for 7.5 million in 1949 45 compared to wind farms hydroelectricity power stations have a more predictable load factor if the project has a storage reservoir it can generate power when needed hydroelectric stations can be easily regulated to follow variations in power demand world hydroelectric capacity world
