americans in 1524 florentine explorer giovanni da verrazzano – sailing in service of king francis i of france – was the first european to visit the area that would become new york city he entered the tidal strait now known as the narrows aboard his ship la dauphine and named the land around upper new york harbor new angoulême in reference to the family name of king francis i that was derived from angoulême in france he sailed far enough into the harbor to sight the hudson river which he referred to in his report to the french king as a very big river and he named the bay of santa margarita – what is now upper new york bay – after marguerite de navarre the elder sister of the king 36 37 it was not until the voyage of henry hudson an englishman who worked for the dutch east india company that the area was mapped 38 hudson came across manhattan island and the native people living there in 1609 and continued up the river that would later bear his name the hudson river until he arrived

canarsee indians of the lenape 44 in exchange for trade goods worth 60 guilders 15 often said to be worth us 24 although accounting for inflation it actually amounts to around us 1,050 in 2014 45 according to the writer nathaniel benchley minuit conducted the transaction with seyseys chief of the canarsees who were only too happy to accept valuable merchandise in exchange for the island that

the site of where the united states supreme court met for the first time 57 the united states bill of rights were drafted and ratified 58 and where the northwest ordinance was adopted establishing measures for adding new states to the union 59 19th century edit manhattan in 1873 the brooklyn bridge was under construction from 1870 until 1883 new york grew as an economic center first as a result of alexander hamilton s policies and practices as the first secretary of the treasury and later with the opening of the erie canal in 1825 which connected the atlantic port to the vast agricultural markets of the midwestern united states and canada 60 61 by 1810 new york city then confined to manhattan had surpassed philadelphia as the largest city in the united states 62 tammany hall a democratic party political machine began to grow in influence with the support of many of the immigrant irish culminating in the election of the first tammany mayor fernando wood in 1854 tammany hall dominated local politics for decades central park which opened to the public in 1858 became the first landscaped public park in an american city b new york city played a complex role in the american civil war the city s strong commercial ties to the american south 64 its growing immigrant population prior to then largely from germany and ireland beginning in the late 1850s waves of italian and central and eastern european jews began flowing in en-masse anger about conscription sizzled and resentment at those who could afford to pay 300 to avoid service led to resentment against lincoln s war policies plus the racial element fomented paranoia about free blacks taking the poor immigrants jobs 65 culminated in the three-day-long new york draft riots of july 1863 these intense war-time riots are counted among the worst incidents of civil disorder in american history with an estimated 119 participants and passersby massacred 66 the rate of immigration from europe grew steeply after the civil war and new york became the first stop for millions seeking a new life in the united states a role acknowledged by the dedication of the statue of liberty on october 28 1886 a gift from the people of france 67 68 the new european immigration brought further social upheaval in a city of tenements packed with poorly paid laborers from dozens of nations the city was a hotbed of revolution including anarchists and communists among others syndicalism racketeering and unionization in 1883 the opening of the brooklyn bridge established a road connection to brooklyn across the east river in 1874 the western portion of the present bronx county was transferred to new york county from westchester county and in 1895 the remainder of the present bronx county was annexed 69 in 1898 when new york city consolidated with three neighboring counties to form the city of greater new york manhattan and the bronx though still one county were established as two separate boroughs on january 1 1914 the new york state legislature created bronx county and new york county was reduced to its present boundaries 70 the sanitary topographical map of the city and island of new york commonly known as the viele map was created by egbert ludovicus viele in 1865 20th century edit manhattan s little italy lower east side circa 1900 the construction of the new york city subway which opened in 1904 helped bind the new city together as did additional bridges to brooklyn in the 1920s manhattan experienced large arrivals of african-americans as part of the great migration from the southern united states and the harlem renaissance part of a larger boom time in the prohibition era that included new skyscrapers competing for the skyline new york city became the most populous city in the world in 1925 overtaking london which had reigned for a century 71 manhattan s majority white ethnic group declined from 98.7 in 1900 to 58.3 by 1990 72 on march 25 1911 the triangle shirtwaist factory fire in greenwich village killed 146 garment workers the disaster eventually led to overhauls of the city s fire department building codes and workplace regulations 73 the period between the world wars saw the election of reformist mayor fiorello la guardia and the fall of tammany hall after 80 years of political dominance 74 as the city s demographics stabilized labor unionization brought new protections and affluence to the working class the city s government and infrastructure underwent a dramatic overhaul under la guardia despite the great depression some of the world s tallest skyscrapers were completed in manhattan during the 1930s including numerous art deco masterpieces that are still part of the city s skyline today most notably the empire state building the chrysler building and the ge building victory over japan day in times square 1945 returning world war ii veterans created a postwar economic boom which led to the development of huge housing developments

manhattan 76 the stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous violent demonstrations by members of the gay community against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of june 28 1969 at the stonewall inn in the greenwich village neighborhood of lower manhattan they are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for lgbt rights in the united states 77 78 in the 1970s job losses due to industrial restructuring caused new york city including manhattan to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates 79 while a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city s economic health in the 1980s new york s crime rate continued to increase through the decade and into the beginning of the 1990s 80 the 1980s saw a rebirth of wall street and manhattan reclaimed its role at the center of the worldwide financial industry the 1980s also saw manhattan at the heart of the aids crisis with greenwich village at its epicenter the organizations gay men s health crisis gmhc and aids coalition to unleash power act up were founded to advocate on behalf of those stricken with the disease by the 1990s crime rates started to drop dramatically due to revised police strategies improving economic opportunities gentrification and new residents both american transplants and new immigrants from asia and latin america murder rates that had reached 2,245 in 1990 plummeted to 537 by 2008 and the crack epidemic and its associated drug-related violence came under greater control

trade center collapsed due to fires and structural damage caused by heavy debris falling from the collapse of the twin towers the other buildings within the world trade center complex were damaged beyond repair and soon after demolished the collapse of the twin towers caused extensive damage to other surrounding buildings and skyscrapers in lower manhattan and resulted in the deaths of 2,606 people in addition to those on the planes since 2001 most of lower manhattan has been restored but there has been controversy surrounding the rebuilding however many rescue workers and residents of the area developed several life-threatening illnesses that have led to some of their subsequent deaths 85 a memorial at the site was opened to the public on september 11 2011 and the museum opened in 2014 in 2014 the new one world trade center at 1,776 feet 541 m and formerly known as the freedom tower became the tallest building in the western hemisphere 86 while other skyscrapers were under

storm surge from new york harbor 88 severe flooding and high winds causing power outages for hundreds of thousands of city residents 89 and leading to gasoline shortages 90 and disruption of mass transit systems 91 92 93 94 the storm and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the borough and the

divided into downtown lower manhattan midtown midtown manhattan and uptown upper manhattan with fifth avenue dividing manhattan s east and west sides manhattan island is bounded by the hudson river to the west and the east river to the east to the north the harlem river divides manhattan island from the bronx and the mainland united states early in the 19th century landfill was used to expand lower manhattan from the natural hudson shoreline at greenwich street to west street 99 when building the world trade center in 1968 1.2 million cubic yards 917,000 m³ of material was excavated from the site 100 rather than dumping the spoil at sea or in landfills the fill material was used to expand the manhattan shoreline across west street creating battery park city 101 the result was a 700-foot 210-m extension into the river running six blocks or 1,484 feet 452 m covering 92 acres 37 ha providing a 1.2-mile 1.9 km riverfront esplanade and over 30 acres 12 ha of parks 102 marble hill edit one neighborhood of new york county is contiguous with the mainland marble hill at one time was part of manhattan island but the harlem river ship canal dug in 1895 to improve navigation on the harlem river separated it from the remainder of manhattan as an island between the bronx and the remainder of manhattan 103 before world war i the section of the original harlem river channel separating marble hill from the bronx was filled in and marble hill became part of the mainland 104 marble hill is one example of how manhattan s land has been considerably altered by human intervention the borough has seen substantial land reclamation along its waterfronts since dutch colonial times and much of the natural variation in its topography has been evened out 34 smaller islands edit see also

central park the bedrock underlying much of manhattan is a mica schist known as manhattan schist 105 it is a strong competent metamorphic rock created when pangaea formed it is well suited for the foundations of tall buildings in central park outcrops of manhattan schist occur and rat rock is one rather large example 106 107 108 geologically a predominant feature of the substrata of manhattan is that the underlying bedrock base of the island rises considerably closer to the surface near midtown manhattan dips down lower between 29th street and canal street then rises toward the surface again in lower manhattan it has been widely believed that the depth to bedrock was the primary underlying reason for the clustering of skyscrapers in the midtown and financial district areas and their absence over the intervening territory between these two areas 109 110 however research has shown that economic factors played a bigger part in the locations of these skyscrapers 111 112 113 updated seismic analysis edit according to the united states geological survey an updated analysis of seismic hazard in july 2014 revealed a slightly lower hazard for tall buildings in manhattan than previously assessed scientists estimated this lessened risk based upon a lower likelihood than previously thought of slow shaking near new york city which would be more likely to cause damage to taller structures from an earthquake in the vicinity of the city 114 locations edit liberty island is an exclave of manhattan of new york city and of new york state surrounded by new jersey waters

manhattan uptown means north more precisely north-northeast which is the direction the island and its street grid system are oriented and downtown means south south-southwest 126 this usage differs from that of most american cities where downtown refers to the central business district manhattan has two central business districts the financial district at the southern tip of the island and midtown manhattan the term uptown also refers to the northern part of manhattan above 72nd street and downtown to the southern portion below 14th street 127 with midtown covering the area in between though definitions can be rather fluid depending on the situation fifth avenue roughly bisects manhattan island and acts as the demarcation line for east west designations e.g. east 27th street west 42nd street street addresses start at fifth avenue and increase heading away from fifth avenue at a rate of 100 per block on most streets 127 south of waverly place fifth avenue terminates and broadway becomes the east west demarcation line though the grid does start with 1st street just north of houston street the southernmost street divided in west and east portions pronounced how-stin the grid does not fully take hold until north of 14th street where nearly all east-west streets are numerically identified which increase from south to north to 220th street the highest numbered street on the island streets in midtown are usually one way with a few exceptions 14th 23rd 34th and 42nd for example the rule of thumb is that odd-numbered streets run west while even-numbered
