is a primary alcohol with a 4 carbon structure and the chemical formula c 4 h 9 oh its isomers include isobutanol 2-butanol and tert butanol butanol is one of the group of fusel alcohols from the german for bad liquor which have more than two carbon atoms and have significant solubility in water n butanol occurs naturally as a minor product of the fermentation of sugars and other carbohydrates 6 and is present in many foods and beverages 7 8 it is also a permitted artificial flavorant in the united states 9 used in butter cream fruit rum whiskey ice cream and ices candy baked goods and cordials 10 it is also used in a wide range of consumer products 7 the largest use of n butanol is as an industrial intermediate particularly for the manufacture of butyl acetate itself an artificial flavorant and industrial solvent it is a petrochemical manufactured from propylene and usually used close to the point of manufacture estimated production figures for 1997 are united states 784,000 tonnes western europe 575,000 tonnes japan 225,000 tonnes 8 production edit n butanol is produced industrially from the petrochemical feedstock propylene propylene is hydroformylated to butyraldehyde oxo process in the presence of a rhodium based homogeneous catalyst similar to wilkinson s catalyst the butyraldehyde is then hydrogenated to produce n butanol 8 industrial use edit n butanol is an intermediate in the production of butyl acrylate butyl acetate dibutyl phthalate dibutyl sebacate and other butyl esters 11 12 butyl ethers such as ethylene glycol monobutyl ether di and triethylene glycol monobutyl ether and the corresponding butyl ether acetates other industrial uses include the manufacture of pharmaceuticals polymers pyroxylin plastics herbicide esters printing e.g. 2,4-d 2,4,5-t 13 and butyl xanthate it is also used as a diluent reactant in the manufacture of urea – formaldehyde and melamine –formaldehyde resins 8 other uses edit n butanol is used as an ingredient in perfumes and as a solvent for the extraction of essential oils 11 n butanol is also used as an extractant in the manufacture of antibiotics hormones and vitamins 11 12 a solvent for paints coatings natural resins gums synthetic resins dyes alkaloids and camphor 11 12 other miscellaneous applications of n butanol are as a swelling agent in textiles as a component of hydraulic brake fluids cleaning formulations degreasers and repellents 7 and as a component of ore floation agents 13 and of wood-treating systems 14 n butanol has been proposed as a substitute for diesel fuel and gasoline it is produced in small quantities in nearly all fermentations see fusel oil but species of clostridium produce much higher yields of butanol and research is currently underway to increase the ultimate yield of biobutanol from biomass the production or in some cases use of the following substances may result in exposure to n butanol artificial leather butyl esters rubber cement dyes fruit essences lacquers motion picture and photographic films raincoats perfumes pyroxylin plastics rayon safety glass shellac varnish and waterproofed cloth 7 occurrence in nature edit honey bees use n-butanol as an alarm pheromone occurrence in food edit n butanol occurs naturally as a result of carbohydrate fermentation in a number of alcoholic beverages including beer 15 grape brandies 16 wine 17 and whisky 18 it has been detected in the volatiles of hops 19 jack fruit 20 heat-treated milks 21 musk melon 22 cheese 23 southern pea seed 24 and cooked rice 25 n butanol is also formed during deep frying of corn oil cottonseed oil trilinolein and triolein 26 n butanol is used as an ingredient in processed and artificial flavourings 11 and for the extraction of lipid-free protein from egg yolk 27 natural flavouring materials and vegetable oils the manufacture of hop extract for beermaking and as a solvent in removing pigments from moist curd leaf protein concentrate 28 metabolism and toxicity edit n butanol is readily absorbed through the intestinal tract and lungs and also to some extent through the skin 29 it is metabolized completely in vertebrates in a manner similar to ethanol alcohol dehydrogenase converts n butanol to butyraldehyde this is then converted to butyric acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase butyric acid can be fully metabolized to carbon dioxide and water by the β-oxidation pathway in the rat only 0.03 of an oral dose of 2000 mg kg was excreted in the urine 30 the acute toxicity of n butanol is relatively low with oral ld 50 values of 790–4360 mg kg rat comparable values for ethanol are 7000–15000 mg kg 8 31 no deaths were reported at an inhaled concentration of 8000 ppm 4-hour exposure rats at sub-lethal doses n butanol acts as a depressant of the central nervous system similar to ethanol one study in rats indicated that the intoxicating potency of n butanol is some six times higher than that of ethanol possibly because of its slower transformation by alcohol dehydrogenase 32 n butanol is a natural component of many alcoholic beverages albeit in low but variable concentrations 33 34 it along with similar fusel alcohols is reputed to be responsible for severe hangovers although experiments in animal models show no evidence for this 35 an unknown dose n butanol was consumed by a 47-year-old male with no previous medical history leading to a range of adverse health effects 36 other hazards edit liquid n butanol as is common with most organic solvents is extremely irritating to the eyes repeated contact with the skin can also cause irritation 8 this is believed to be a generic effect of defatting no skin sensitization has been observed irritation of the respiratory pathways occurs only at very high concentrations 2400 ppm 37 with a flash point of 35 °c n butanol presents a moderate fire hazard it is slightly more flammable than kerosene or diesel fuel but less flammable than many other common organic solvents the depressant effect on the central nervous system similar to ethanol intoxication is a potential hazard when working with n butanol in enclosed spaces although the odour threshold 0.2–30 ppm is far below the concentration which would have any neurological effect 37 38 n butanol is of low toxicity to aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates it is rapidly biodegraded in water although an estimated 83 partitions to air where it is degraded by hydroxyl radicals with a half-life of 1.2–2.3 days it has low potential to bioaccumulate 8 a potential hazard of significant discharges to watercourses is the rise in chemical oxygen demand c.o.d associated with its biodegradation
