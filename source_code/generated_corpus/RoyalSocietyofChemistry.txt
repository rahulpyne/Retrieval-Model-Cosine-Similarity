college courses equivalent to a chemistry degree and overseen by the rsc 19 it replaced the gric offered by the royal institute of chemistry divisions edit the society is organised around 9 divisions based on subject areas and local sections both in the united kingdom and overseas divisions cover broad areas of chemistry but also contain many special interest groups for more specific areas analytical division for analytical chemistry and promoting the original aims of the society for analytical chemistry 12 subject groups dalton division named after john dalton for inorganic chemistry 6 subject groups education division for chemical education 4 subject groups faraday division named after michael faraday for physical chemistry and promoting the original aims of the faraday society 14 subject groups organic division for organic chemistry 6 subject groups chemical biology interface division 2 subject groups environment sustainability and energy division 3 subject groups materials chemistry division 4 subject groups industry and technology division 13 subject groups there are 12 subjects groups not attached to a division local sections edit there are 35 local sections covering the united kingdom and ireland in countries of the commonwealth of nations and many other countries there are local representatives of the society and often some activities publications edit see also

w abel and the 8 books in the molecular world series whose coordinating editor is l e smart books on the history of chemistry such as a history of the faraday society subscriptions to the journals are available individually or all-in under a provision called rsc gold 21 burlington house edit burlington house established 2010 location piccadilly london w1 england website www rsc org the london offices of the society are in burlington house piccadilly events are hosted here for the public rsc member groups and external organisations including monthly lectures on the chemical sciences that streamed live via the rsc s public engagement website – the reaction the free lectures take an interesting look at the chemical aspects of a wide range of topics from curry to the enjoyment of music the events have attracted notable science writers such as philip ball antony john williams and john emsley to give public lectures most of these are available as archived video streams via the rsc s reaction website 22 history edit although opened as the chemistry centre in 2010 the building has been occupied by the royal society of chemistry since 1857 at which time it was known as the chemical society – the heart of the chemistry centre is the rsc s library and information centre which itself dates back to 1842 over the years the library for the rsc has received many gifts from notable fellows including michael faraday the library became a centre for information on the chemical sciences during the 1st and 2nd world wars when extensive use was made on the chemical reference material available in november 2014 the society announced that the centre would be rebranded as simply royal society of chemistry at burlington house and the name chemistry centre dropped library and information centre edit the society has a large library covering mainly chemistry-based subjects including online access for members housed at the chemistry centre at burlington house it is part of the chemistry centre and is a resource for rsc members although the public are also welcome benevolent fund edit the staircase at the royal society of chemistry burlington house designed by the partnership of robert richardson banks and charles barry jr the royal society of chemistry s benevolent fund supports the members and their families during difficult times through advice and guidance financial support and volunteer support 23 it dates back to 1920 when the institute of chemistry later the royal institute of chemistry established it as a memorial to its members who died in the first world war it had an aim to help necessitous persons who are or have been fellows or associates of the institute their wives or children and the widows and dependent relatives of deceased fellows and associates through voluntary contributions from members the benevolent fund s ethos of members helping members stems from the institute of chemistry s council raising money for members in need from other members prior to the fund being formed 24 in 1960 the benevolent fund introduced a volunteer visitor system where members were asked to visit applicants beneficiaries elderly and housebound members in their area each local section was also appointed a fund representative 25 a major review of the fund to modernize it took place in 2003-2004 forming a new strategy document that is updated every three years it underwent another review in 2014 with the aim to widen its reach and provide a more holistic support wider than financial assistance to royal society of chemistry members and their families 26 the benevolent fund committee formed of volunteer members of the royal society of chemistry oversees the benevolent fund and meet every three months 27 prizes and awards edit main article list of royal society of chemistry medals and awards the rsc awards a variety of prizes and awards each year that include awards for excellence in any area of chemistry in specialist areas or for achievement at particular stages of a chemist s career 28 medals are awarded centrally by the rsc and by the divisions of the organisation there are also awards that are administered by rsc interest groups the centrally awarded medals include the harrison-meldola memorial prizes which are awarded to a british chemist who is under 32 years of age for promising original investigations in chemistry 29 and the corday-morgan medals which consist of three separate awards made for the most meritorious contributions to experimental chemistry including computer simulation 30 the tilden prize previously known as the tilden lecture consists of three awards annually to scientists in mid-career for advances in chemistry previous winners of the harrison-meldola prize known as the meldola medal and prize prior to its merger in 2008 with the edward harrison prize include christopher kelk ingold 1921 1922 cyril norman hinshelwood 1923 r.h stokes 1946 d.h williams 1966 and j evans 1978

arms two forms exist the full coat of arms has lion and unicorn bearers and the latin motto pro scientia et humanitate for the sake of knowledge and for the benefit of mankind the smaller version uses just the central shield which is similar to that in the royal institute of chemistry s arms coat of arms shield arms on the society s robert boyle prize for analytical science medal other resources edit the interactive lab primer is a site developed to provide tips to a variety of chemical experimentation skills 32 the site covers basic lab safety tips demonstrates primary lab techniques introduces a couple common lab apparatus in lab and provides other references the society s chemspider is a database of chemicals and chemical properties the society operates a blue plaque scheme landmarks of chemistry erecting plaques at places associated with notable chemical events or people 33 recent plaques are hexagonal
