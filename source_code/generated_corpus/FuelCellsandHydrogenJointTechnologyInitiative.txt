framework programmes for research and technological development wikipedia framework programmes for research and technological development from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from fuel cells and hydrogen joint technology initiative jump to navigation search the framework programmes for research and technological development also called framework programmes or abbreviated fp1 to fp7 with fp8 being named horizon 2020 are funding programmes created by the european union european commission to support and foster research in the european research area era the specific objectives and actions vary between funding periods in fp6 and fp7 focus was still in technological research in horizon 2020 the focus is in innovation delivering economic growth faster and delivering solutions to end users that are often governmental agencies background edit conducting european research policies and implementing european research programmes is an obligation under the amsterdam treaty which includes a chapter on research and technological development the programmes are defined by commission civil servants that are aided by various official advisory group and lobby groups e.g to advise the european commission on the overall strategy to be followed in carrying out the information and communication technology thematic priority the information society technologies advisory group istag was set up 1 the framework programmes edit the framework programmes up until framework programme 6 fp6 covered five-year periods but from framework programme 7 fp7 on programmes run for seven years the framework programmes and their budgets in billions of euros are presented in the table below 2 for fp1–fp5 program expenditures were made in european currency units from fp6 onward budgets were in euros the values presented below are in euros id framework programme period budget billions of € fp1 first 3 1984–1987 3.8 fp2 second 4 1987–1991 5.4 fp3 third 5 1990–1994 6.6 fp4 fourth 6 1994–1998 13.2 fp5 fifth 7 1998–2002 15.0 fp6 sixth 8 2002–2006 17.9 fp7 seventh 2007–2013 50.5 over seven years 2.7 for euratom over five years 9 fp8 horizon 2020 eighth 10 2014–2020 80 estimated 11 funding instruments edit fp6 and fp7 edit framework programme 6 and 7 2002–13 projects were generally funded through instruments the most important of which are listed below integrating project ip medium to large-sized collaborative research projects funded in fp6 and fp7 they are composed of a minimum of three partners coming from three different countries from associated states but can join several tens of partners the typical duration of such projects is three to five years but there is not a defined upper limit the budget granted by the commission can reach several tens of million euros paid as a fraction of the actual costs spent by the participants 12 ips specifically aim at fostering european competitiveness in basic research and applied science with a focus on addressing major needs in society defined by the priority themes of the framework programme like streps see below ips ask for a strong participation of small or medium-sized enterprises smes to ascertain the translation of research results into commercially viable products or services 13 network of excellence noe medium-sized research projects co-funded by the european commission in fp6 and fp7 these projects are designed to strengthen scientific and technological excellence on a particular research topic through the durable integration of the research capacities of the participants 14 noe projects require the minimum participation of three different eu member nations however projects are usually expected to involve at least six countries 15 projects are provided grants for a maximum of seven years the budget granted by the commission is €1–6 million per year depending upon the number of researchers involved 15 an noe project should not strictly be considered as a research project since its aim is not to conduct research but rather to contribute to the clarification of the concepts in the covered field citation needed specific targeted research projects strep medium-sized research projects funded by the european commission in the fp6 and fp7 funding programs strep projects are composed by a minimum of three partners coming from three different countries from associated states the typical duration of such projects is two to three years in fp6 they generally involved between six and 15 partners the budget granted by the commission is in average around €2 million 16 horizon 2020 edit horizon 2020 is the eighth framework programme funding research technological development and innovation the programme s name has been modified to framework programme for research and innovation the framework programme is implemented by the european commission the executive body of the european union either by various internal directorate general dgs such as the directorate general for research and innovation dg rtd or the directorate general for communications networks content and technology or by executive agencies such as the research executive agency rea the executive agency for smes easme or the erc executive agency ercea the framework programme s objective is to complete the european research area era by coordinating national research policies and pooling research funding in some areas to avoid duplication horizon 2020 itself is seen as a policy instrument to implement other high-level policy initiatives of the european union such as europe 2020 and innovation union the programme runs from 2014–20 and provides an estimated € 80 billion of funding 17 18 an increase of 23 per cent on the previous phase 19 horizon 2020 provides grants to research and innovation projects through open and competitive calls for proposals legal entities from any country are eligible to submit project proposals to these calls participation from outside the european union is explicitly encouraged 20 participants from european union member states and countries associated to horizon 2020 are automatically funded associated countries have signed an association agreement for the purposes of this framework programme to date 14 countries are associated to horizon 2020 21 switzerland is considered as partly associated due to the 2014 referendums held by switzerland which free movement of workers between switzerland and the eu swiss organisations continue to be active participants in horizon 2020 however their participation is sometimes covered by national funding israel is an associated country to horizon 2020 a central point of negotiation was funding to projects beyond the green line 22 israel published its views in an appendix to the official documents horizon 2020 supports open access to research results 23 in order to create greater efficiency improve transparency and accelerate innovation 24 horizon 2020 is also implementing the european environmental research and innovation policy which is aimed at defining and turning into reality a transformative agenda for greening the economy and the society as a whole so as to achieve a truly sustainable development structure edit the programme consists of three main research areas that are called pillars the first pillar excellent science focuses on basic science it has a budget of 24 billion euro the european research council erc delivers 13 billion euro to researchers and teams of researchers based on scientific excellence of the applications this pillar funds future and emerging technologies fet €2.7 billion and researcher mobility marie sklodowska-curie action msca €6.1 billion and large european research infrastructures €2.5 billion msca supports the career development and training of researchers at all stages of their careers it is the main eu programme for doctoral training funding 25,000 phds during seven years it co-funds national phd programmes other msca funding targets research networks fellowships for individual researchers research staff exchanges and arrange european researchers night event annually on the last friday of september the second pillar is industrial leadership with a budget of 14 billion euro it is managed by dg enterprise and based on europe 2020 and innovation union strategies the pillar consists of six sub-programmes within leadership in enabling and industrial technologies information and communication technologies nanotechnologies advanced materials advanced manufacturing and processing biotechnology space these technologies all have european technology platforms etp fora for research communities to meet with their respective strategic research agendas sra some technologies have long term funding instruments such as joint technology initiatives jti some technologies are labelled key enabling technologies ket this pillar contains special efforts to sme funding and gives also risk financing 2.8 billion euro e.g through loans of the european investment bank the third pillar funds potential solutions to social and economic problems societal challenges sc in the following seven sub-programmes health €7.5 billion food water forestry bioeconomy €3.8 billion energy €5.9 billion transport €6.3 billion climate action environment resource efficiency and raw materials €3.1 billion 25 european society €1.3 billion security €1.7 billion this pillar also funds themes names as science with and for society €0.5 billion and spreading excellence and widening participation €0.8 billion the structure follows the previous framework programme fp7 2007–13 to the level of the sub-programmes under the pillars in the industrial pillar the goal is to find ways to modernize european industries that have suffered from a fragmented european market in societal challenges the goal is implementation of solutions less on technology development illustrative projects edit openaire edit a network of open access repositories archives and journals that support open access policies the openaire consortium is a horizon 2020 fp8 project aimed to support the implementation of the ec and erc open access policies its successor openaireplus is aimed at linking the aggregated research publications to the accompanying research and project information datasets and author information open access to scientific peer reviewed publications has evolved from a pilot project with limited scope in fp7 to an underlying principle in the horizon 2020 funding scheme obligatory for all h2020 funded projects the goal is to make as much european funded research output as possible available to all via the openaire portal openaire.eu faq 26 the zenodo research data repository is a product of openaire the openaire portal is at https www.openaire.eu criticism of the programmes edit the programmes have been criticized on various grounds such as actually diminishing europe s industrial competitiveness 27 and failing to deliver fundamental excellence and global economic competitiveness 28 in 2010 the austrian research promotion agency launched a petition calling for a simplification of administrative procedures which attracted over 13,000 signatories 29 the numerous other criticisms of the petitioners were later distilled into a green paper 30 in horizon 2020 there are significant simplifications e.g fewer funding rates increasing the funding rates of the large companies less reporting less auditing shorter time from proposal to project kick-off
