www.epa.gov the united states environmental protection agency 2 epa or sometimes usepa is an agency of the federal government of the united states which was created for the purpose of protecting human health and the environment by writing and enforcing regulations based on laws passed by congress 3 the epa was proposed by president richard nixon and began operation on december 2 1970 after nixon signed an executive order the order establishing the epa was ratified by committee hearings in the house and senate 4 the agency is led by its administrator who is appointed by the president and approved by congress the current administrator is gina mccarthy 5 the epa is not a cabinet department but the administrator is normally given cabinet rank the epa has its headquarters in washington d.c regional offices for each of the agency s ten regions and 27 laboratories the agency conducts environmental assessment research and education it has the responsibility of maintaining and enforcing national standards under a variety of environmental laws in consultation with state tribal and local governments it delegates some permitting monitoring and enforcement responsibility to u.s states and the federally recognized tribes epa enforcement powers include fines sanctions and other measures the agency also works with industries and all levels of government in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts the agency has approximately 15,193 full-time employees 6 and engages many more people on a contractual basis more than half of epa human resources are engineers scientists and environmental protection specialists other groups include legal public affairs financial and information technologists history edit stacks emitting smoke from burning discarded automobile batteries photo taken in houston in 1972 by marc st gil cs official photographer of recently founded epa same smokestacks in 1975 after the plant was closed in a push for greater environmental protection beginning in the late 1950s 7 and through the 1960s congress reacted to increasing public concern about the impact that human activity could have on the environment a key legislative option to address this concern was the declaration of a national environmental policy 8 advocates of this approach argued that without a specific policy federal agencies were neither able nor inclined to consider the environmental impacts of their actions in fulfilling the agency s mission citation needed the statute that ultimately addressed this issue was the national environmental policy act of 1969 nepa 42 u.s.c §§ 4321–4347 9 senator henry m jackson proposed and helped write s 1075 the bill that eventually became the national environmental policy act the law was signed by president nixon on january 1 1970 nepa was the first of several major environmental laws passed in the 1970s it declared a national policy to protect the environment and created a council on environmental quality ceq in the executive office of the president citation needed to implement the national policy nepa required that a detailed statement of environmental impacts be prepared for all major federal actions significantly affecting the environment the detailed statement would ultimately be referred to as an environmental impact statement eis ruckelshaus sworn in as first epa administrator in 1970 president richard nixon proposed an executive reorganization that would consolidate many of the federal government s environmental responsibilities under one agency a new environmental protection agency that reorganization proposal was reviewed and passed by the house and senate 10 staff recall that in the early days there was “an enormous sense of purpose and excitement” and the expectation that “there was this agency which was going to do something about a problem that clearly was on the minds of a lot of people in this country,” leading to tens of thousands of resumes from those eager to participate in the mighty effort to clean up america’s environment 11 for at least 10 years before nepa was enacted 12 better source needed congress debated issues that the act would ultimately address citation needed the act was modeled on the resources and conservation act of 1959 introduced by senator james e murray in the 86th congress 13 that bill would have established an environmental advisory counsel in the office of the president declared a national environmental policy and required the preparation of an annual environmental report 14 better source needed in the years following the introduction of senator murray s bill similar bills were introduced and hearings were held to discuss the state of the environment and congress s potential responses to perceived problems in 1968 a joint house-senate colloquium was convened by the chairmen of the senate committee on interior and insular affairs senator henry m jackson and the house committee on science and astronautics representative george miller to discuss the need for and potential means of implementing a national environmental policy in the colloquium some members of congress expressed a continuing concern over federal agency actions affecting the environment 15 when epa first began the private sector felt strongly that the environmental protection movement was a passing fad and the agency’s first administrator william ruckelshaus felt pressure to show a public that was deeply skeptical about government’s effectiveness that epa could respond effectively to widespread concerns about pollution 16 the epa began regulating greenhouse gases ghgs from mobile and stationary sources of air pollution under the clean air act caa for the first time on january 2 2011 standards for mobile sources have been established pursuant to section 202 of the caa and ghgs from stationary sources are controlled under the authority of part c of title i of the act see the

worth noting that in looking back in 2013 on the agency he helped shape from the beginning administrator william ruckelshaus observed that a danger for epa was that air water waste and other programs would be unconnected placed in “silos,” a problem that persists more than 50 years later albeit less so than at the start 33 epa safer choice edit the epa safer choice label previously known as the design for the environment dfe label helps consumers and commercial buyers identify and select products with safer chemical ingredients without sacrificing quality or performance when a product has the safer choice label it means that every intentionally added ingredient in the product has been evaluated by epa scientists only the safest possible functional ingredients are allowed in products with the safer choice label safer detergents stewardship initiative edit through the safer detergents stewardship initiative sdsi 34 epa s design for the environment dfe recognizes environmental leaders who voluntarily commit to the use of safer surfactants safer surfactants are the ones that break down quickly to non-polluting compounds and help protect aquatic life in both fresh and salt water nonylphenol ethoxylates commonly referred to as npes are an example of a surfactant class that does not meet the definition of a safer surfactant the design for the environment which was renamed to epa safer choice in 2015 has identified safer alternative surfactants through partnerships with industry and environmental advocates these safer alternatives are comparable in cost and are readily available cleangredients 35 is a source of safer surfactants energy star edit main article energy star in 1992 the epa launched the energy star program a voluntary program that fosters energy efficiency smartgrowth edit epa s smart growth program helps communities improve their development practices and get the type of development they want epa works with local state and national experts to discover and encourage development strategies that protect human health and the environment create economic opportunities and provide attractive and affordable neighborhoods for people of all income levels 36 pesticides edit epa administers the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra which is much older than the agency and registers all pesticides legally sold in the united states fuel economy edit manufacturers selling automobiles in the united states are required to provide epa fuel economy test results for their vehicles and the manufacturers are not allowed to provide results from alternate sources the fuel economy is calculated using the emissions data collected during two of the vehicle s clean air act certification tests by measuring the total volume of carbon captured from the exhaust during the tests the current testing system was originally developed in 1972 and used driving cycles designed to simulate driving during rush-hour in los angeles during that era prior to 1984 the epa reported the exact fuel economy figures calculated from the test in 1984 the epa began adjusting city aka urban dynamometer driving schedule or udds results downward by 10 and highway aka highway fuel economy test or hwfet results by 22 to compensate for changes in driving conditions since 1972 and to better correlate the epa test results with real-world driving in 1996 the epa proposed updating the federal testing procedures 37 to add a new higher speed test us06 and an air-conditioner on test sc03 to further improve the correlation of fuel economy and emission estimates with real-world reports the updated testing methodology was finalized in december 2006 for implementation with model year 2008 vehicles and set the precedent of a 12-year review cycle for the test procedures 38 in february 2005 the organization launched a program called your mpg 39 that allows drivers to add real-world fuel economy statistics into a database on the epa s fuel economy website and compare them with others and the original epa test results it is important to note that the epa actually conducts these tests on very few vehicles while the public mistakenly presumes that this federal agency is hard at work conducting complicated tests on every new model of truck van car and suv in reality just 18 of the epa s 17,000 employees work in the automobile-testing department in ann arbor michigan examining 200 to 250 vehicles a year or roughly 15 percent of new models as to that other 85 percent the epa takes automakers at their word—without any testing-accepting submitted results as accurate 40 two-thirds of the vehicles the epa tests themselves are selected randomly and the remaining third are tested for specific reasons although originally created as a reference point for fossil fuelled vehicles driving cycles have been used for estimating how many miles an electric vehicle will do on a single charge 41 air quality edit the air quality modeling group aqmg is in the epa s office of air and radiation oar and provides leadership and direction on the full range of air quality models air pollution dispersion models 42 43 and other mathematical simulation techniques used in assessing pollution control strategies and the impacts of air pollution sources the aqmg serves as the focal point on air pollution modeling techniques for other epa headquarters staff epa regional offices and state and local environmental agencies it coordinates with the epa s office of research and development ord on the development of new models and techniques as well as wider issues of atmospheric research finally the aqmg conducts modeling analyses to support the policy and regulatory decisions of the epa s office of air quality planning and standards oaqps the aqmg is located in research triangle park north carolina addressing air quality issues helps diminish the risk of pollution-related diseases oil pollution edit the spill prevention control and countermeasure rule applies to all facilities that store handle process gather transfer store refine distribute use or consume oil or oil products oil products includes petroleum and non-petroleum oils as well as animal fats oils and greases fish and marine mammal oils and vegetable oils including oils from seeds nuts fruits and kernels mandates that a written plan is required for facilities that store more than 1,320 gallons of fuel above ground or more than 42,000 gallons below-ground and may reasonably be expected to discharge to navigable waters as defined in the clean water act or adjoining shorelines secondary containment mandated at oil storage facilities oil release containment is required at oil development sites toxics release inventory edit the toxics release inventory tri is a resource for learning about toxic chemical releases and pollution prevention activities reported by industrial and federal facilities tri data support informed decision-making by communities government agencies companies and others 44 epa watersense edit main article watersense watersense is an epa program designed to encourage water efficiency in the united states through the use of a special label on consumer products it was launched in june 2006 45 products include high-efficiency toilets hets bathroom sink faucets and accessories and irrigation equipment watersense is a voluntary program with epa developing specifications for water-efficient products through a public process and product testing by independent laboratories 46 drinking water edit main article safe drinking water act epa ensures safe drinking water for the public by setting standards for more than 160,000 public water systems nationwide epa oversees states local governments and water suppliers to enforce the standards under the safe drinking water act the program includes regulation of injection wells in order to protect underground sources of drinking water select readings of amounts of certain contaminants in drinking water precipitation and surface water in addition to milk and air are reported on epa s rad net web site in a section entitled envirofacts in certain cases readings exceeding epa mcl levels are deleted or not included 47 48 despite mandatory reporting regulations a draft of revised epa regulations relaxes the regulations for radiation exposure through drinking water stating that current standards are impractical to enforce the epa is recommending that intervention is not necessary until drinking water is contaminated with radioactive iodine 131 at a concentration of 81,000 picocuries per liter the limit for short term exposure set by the international atomic energy agency which is 27,000 times the current epa limit of 3 picocuries per liter for long term exposure 49 national pollutant discharge elimination system edit the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit program addresses water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge pollutants to waters of the united states created in 1972 by the clean water act the npdes permit program is authorized to state governments by epa to perform many permitting administrative and enforcement aspects of the program 50 radiation protection edit epa has the following seven project groups to protect the public from radiation 51 radioactive waste management 52 emergency preparedness and response programs 53 protective action guides and planning guidance for radiological incidents epa developed the manual 54 to provide guideline for local and state governments to protect public from nuclear accident epa cleanup and multi-agency programs 55 risk assessment and federal guidance programs 56 naturally-occurring radioactive materials program 57 air and water programs 58 radiation source reduction and management 59 tools for schools edit the rate of asthma in children is increasing at a pace that underscores the need for schools to address indoor air problems epa s indoor air quality tools for schools program helps maintain a healthy environment and reduce exposures to indoor environmental contaminants the program helps school personnel identify solve and prevent indoor air quality problems in the school environment through the use of a multi-step management plan and checklists for the entire building schools can also lower their students and staff s risk of exposure to asthma triggers 60 environmental education edit the national environmental education act of 1990 requires epa to provide national leadership to increase environmental literacy epa established the office of environmental education to implement this program 61 environmental impact statement reviews edit epa is responsible for reviewing environmental impact statements of other federal agencies projects under the national environmental policy act nepa clean school bus usa edit clean school bus usa is a national partnership to reduce children s exposure to diesel exhaust by eliminating unnecessary school bus idling installing effective emission control systems on newer buses and replacing the oldest buses in the fleet with newer ones its goal is to reduce both children s exposure to diesel exhaust and the amount of air pollution created by diesel school buses 62 research vessel edit main article usns bold t-agos-12 osv bold docked at port canaveral fl on march 3 2004 the united states navy transferred usns bold a stalwart class ocean surveillance ship to the epa now known as osv bold the ship previously used in anti-submarine operations during the cold war is equipped with sidescan sonar underwater video water and sediment sampling instruments used in study of ocean and coastline one of the major missions of the bold was to monitor for ecological impact sites where materials are dumped from dredging operations in u.s ports 63 in 2013 the bold was awarded to seattle central community college sccc by the general services administration sccc demonstrated in a competition that they would put it to the highest and best purpose and acquired the ship at a cost of 5,000 64 advance identification edit advance identification or adid is a planning process used by the epa to identify wetlands and other bodies of water and their respective suitability for the discharge of dredged and fill material the epa conducts the process in cooperation with the u.s army corps of engineers and local states or native american tribes as of february 1993 38 adid projects had been completed and 33 were ongoing 65 freedom of information act processing performance edit in the latest center for effective government analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most freedom of information act foia requests published in 2015 using 2012 and 2013 data the most recent years available the epa earned a d by scoring 67 out of a possible 100 points i.e did not earn a satisfactory overall grade 66 controversies edit epa headquarters in washington d.c there has been political controversy who over whether environmental regulations generally increase or decrease national employment 67 68 69 70 the lt2 drinking water controversy edit in 2005 the epa issued the long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule lt2 71 the rule requires covering open-air reservoirs containing finished drinking water in order to reduce the incidence of disease caused by microorganisms in drinking water to comply with the rule the epa ordered that a cap be placed over the hillview reservoir the open reservoir where water bound for new york city’s receives its final disinfection before entering the pipelines that serve the city 72 a number of city and state officials complained that the project was too costly and unnecessary 73 the hillview project is currently being reviewed by the epa in portland oregon there was opposition to capping its reservoirs from a local citizens group and city officials but recently the city has decided to stop fighting and bring its reservoirs into compliance with lt2 74 75 fiscal mismanagement edit epa director anne m gorsuch resigned under fire in 1983 during a scandal over mismanagement of a 1.6 billion program to clean up hazardous waste dumps gorsuch based her administration of the epa on the new federalism approach of downsizing federal agencies by delegating their functions and services to the individual states 76 she believed that the epa was over-regulating business and that the agency was too large and not cost-effective during her 22 months as agency head she cut the budget of the epa by 22 reduced the number of cases filed against polluters relaxed clean air act regulations and facilitated the spraying of restricted-use pesticides she cut the total number of agency employees and hired staff from the industries they were supposed to be regulating 77 environmentalists contended that her policies were designed to placate polluters and accused her of trying to dismantle the agency 78 in 1982 congress charged that the epa had mishandled the 1.6 billion toxic waste superfund and demanded records from gorsuch gorsuch refused and became the first agency director in u.s history to be cited for contempt of congress the epa turned the documents over to congress several months later after the white house abandoned its court claim that the documents could not be subpoened by congress because they were covered by executive privilege at that point gorsuch resigned her post citing pressures caused by the media and the congressional investigation 79 critics charged that the epa was in a shambles at that time 80 fuel economy edit in july 2005 an epa report showing that auto companies were using loopholes to produce less fuel-efficient cars was delayed the report was supposed to be released the day before a controversial energy bill was passed and would have provided backup for those opposed to it but at the last minute the epa delayed its release 81 the state of california sued the epa for its refusal to allow california and 16 other states to raise fuel economy standards for new cars 82 epa administrator stephen l johnson claimed that the epa was working on its own standards but the move has been widely considered an attempt to shield the auto industry from environmental regulation by setting lower standards at the federal level which would then preempt state laws 83 84 85 california governor arnold schwarzenegger along with governors from 13 other states stated that the epa s actions ignored federal law and that existing california standards adopted by many states in addition to california were almost twice as effective as the proposed federal standards 86 it was reported that stephen johnson ignored his own staff in making this decision 87 after the federal government bailed out general motors and chrysler in the automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010 the 2010 chevrolet equinox was released with epa fuel economy rating abnormally higher than its competitors independent road tests 88 89 90 91 found that the vehicle did not out-perform its competitors which had much lower fuel economy ratings later road tests 92 93 found better but inconclusive results palm-based biodiesel and renewable diesel failed to meet the minimum 20 greenhouse gas ghg emissions savings threshold requirement to qualify as renewable fuels under the us renewable fuel standard 2 94 palm oil plantations threaten the habitats of the endangered orang-utan and dwarf elephant 95 global warming edit wikinews has related news epa proposes using clean air act to fight global warming in december 2007 epa administrator stephen l johnson approved a draft of a document that declared that climate change imperiled the public welfare—a decision that would trigger the first national mandatory global-warming regulations associate deputy administrator jason burnett e-mailed the draft to the white house white house aides—who had long resisted mandatory regulations as a way to address climate change—knew the gist of what johnson s finding would be burnett said they also knew that once they opened the attachment it would become a public record making it controversial and difficult to rescind so they did not open it rather they called johnson and asked him to take back the draft u.s law clearly stated that the final decision was the epa administrator s not president bush s johnson rescinded the draft in july 2008 he issued a new version which did not state that global warming was danger to public welfare burnett resigned in protest 96 libraries edit in 2004 the agency began a strategic planning exercise to develop plans for a more virtual approach to library services the effort was curtailed in july 2005 when the agency proposed a 2.5 million cut in its 2007 budget for libraries based on the proposed 2007 budget the epa posted a notice to the federal register september 20 2006 that epa headquarters library would close its doors to walk-in patrons and visitors on october 1 2006 97 the epa also closed some of its regional libraries and reduced hours in others 98 using the same fy 2007 proposed budget numbers on october 1 2008 the agency re-opened regional libraries in chicago dallas and kansas city and the library at its headquarters in washington dc 99 in june 2011 the epa library network published a strategic plan 100 for fiscal years 2012–2014 mercury emissions edit in march 2005 nine states california new york new jersey new hampshire massachusetts maine connecticut new mexico and vermont sued the epa the epa s inspector general had determined that the epa s regulation of mercury emissions did not follow the clean air act and that the regulations were influenced by top political appointees 101 102 the epa had suppressed a study it commissioned by harvard university which contradicted its position on mercury controls 103 the suit alleges that the epa s rule allowing exemption from maximum available control technology was illegal and additionally charged that the epa s system of pollution credit trading allows power plants to forego reducing mercury emissions 104 several states also began to enact their own mercury emission regulations illinois s proposed rule would have reduced mercury emissions from power plants by an average of 90 by 2009 105 9 11 air ratings edit main article epa 9 11 pollution controversy an august 2003 report released by epa s inspector general claimed that the white house put pressure on the epa to delete cautionary information about the air quality in new york city around ground zero following the september 11 2001 attacks an environmental protection agency employee checks one of the many air sampling locations set up around the world trade center site very fine airborne particulates edit tiny particles under 2.5 micrometres are attributed to health and mortality concerns 106 so some health advocates want the epa to regulate it the science may be in its infancy although many conferences have discussed the trails of this airborne matter in the air foreign governments such as australia 107 and most member state of the european union have addressed this issue the epa first established standards in 1997 and strengthened them in 2006 as with other standards regulation and enforcement of the pm 2.5 standards is the responsibility of the state governments through state implementation plans 108 political pressure and scientific integrity edit in april 2008 the union of concerned scientists said that more than half of the nearly 1,600 epa staff scientists who responded online to a detailed questionnaire reported they had experienced incidents of political interference in their work the survey included chemists toxicologists engineers geologists and experts in other fields of science about 40 of the scientists reported that the interference had been more prevalent in the last five years than in previous years the highest number of complaints came from scientists who were involved in determining the risks of cancer by chemicals used in food and other aspects of everyday life 109 epa research has also been suppressed by career managers 110 supervisors at epa s national center for environmental assessment required several paragraphs to be deleted from a peer-reviewed journal article about epa s integrated risk information system which led two co-authors to have their names removed from the publication and the corresponding author ching-hung hsu to leave epa because of the draconian restrictions placed on publishing 111 epa subjects employees who author scientific papers to prior restraint even if those papers are written on personal time 112 a 3 million mapping study on sea level rise was suppressed by epa management during both the bush and obama administrations and managers changed a key interagency report to reflect the removal of the maps 113 epa employees have reported difficulty in conducting and reporting the results of studies on hydraulic fracturing due to industry 114 115 116 and governmental pressure and are concerned about the censorship of environmental reports 114 117 118 in 2015 the government accountability office stated that the epa violated federal law with covert propaganda on their social media platforms the social media messaging that was used promoted materials supporting the waters of the united states rule including materials that were designed to oppose legislative efforts to limit or block the rule 119 environmental justice edit the epa has been criticized for its lack of progress towards environmental justice administrator christine todd whitman was criticized for her changes to president bill clinton s executive order 12898 during 2001 removing the requirements for government agencies to take the poor and minority populations into special consideration when making changes to environmental legislation and therefore defeating the spirit of the executive order 120 in a march 2004 report the inspector general of the agency concluded that the epa has not developed a clear vision or a comprehensive strategic plan and has not established values goals expectations and performance measurements for environmental justice in its daily operations another report in september 2006 found the agency still had failed to review the success of its programs policies and activities towards environmental justice 121 studies have also found that poor and minority populations were underserved by the epa s superfund program and that this situation was worsening 120 barriers to enforcing environmental justice edit localization edit many issues of environmental justice are localized and are therefore hard to be addressed by federal agencies such as the epa without significant media attention political interest or crisis status local issues are less likely to be addressed at the local or federal level with a still developing sector of environmental justice under the epa small local incidents are unlikely to be solved compared to larger well publicized incidents conflicting political powers edit the white house maintains direct control over the epa and its enforcements are subject to the political agenda of who is in power republicans and democrats differ in their approaches to and perceived concerns of environmental justice while president bill clinton signed the executive order 12898 the bush administration did not develop a clear plan or establish goals for integrating environmental justice into everyday practices which in turn affected the motivation for environmental enforcement 122 responsibilities of the epa edit the epa is responsible for preventing and detecting environmental crimes informing the public of environmental enforcement and setting and monitoring standards of air pollution water pollution hazardous wastes and chemicals while the epa aids in preventing and identifying hazardous situations it is hard to construct a specific mission statement given its wide range of responsibilities 123 it is impossible to address every environmental crime adequately or efficiently if there is no specific mission statement to refer to the epa answers to various groups competes for resources and confronts a wide array
