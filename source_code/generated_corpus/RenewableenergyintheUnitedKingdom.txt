chapter 6 renewable sources of energy 2 renewable energy in the united kingdom can be divided into the generation of renewable electricity the generation of renewable heat and renewable energy use in the transport sector from the mid-1990s renewable energy began to contribute to the electricity generated in the united kingdom adding to a small hydroelectricity generating capacity the total of all renewable electricity sources provided for 14.9 of the electricity generated in the united kingdom in 2013 3 reaching 53.7 twh of electricity generated in the second quarter of 2015 renewable electricity penetration exceeded 25 and coal generation for the first time 4 renewable energy contributions to meeting the uk s 15 target reduction in total energy consumption by 2020 in accordance with the 2009 eu renewable directive totalled 5.2 in 2013 as measured in accordance with the methodology set out in the directive 3 by 2016 provisional calculations show that the figure had risen again to 8.3 per cent of energy consumption all sources coming from renewable sources in 2015 5 interest in renewable energy in the uk has increased in recent years due to new uk and eu targets for reductions in carbon emissions and the promotion of renewable electricity power generation through commercial incentives such as the renewable obligation certificate scheme rocs and feed in tariffs fits and the promotion of renewable heat through the renewable heat incentive historically hydroelectric schemes were the largest producers of renewable electricity in the uk but these have now been surpassed by wind power schemes for which the uk has large potential resources history edit renewable heat energy in the form of biofuels dates back to 415,000 bp in the uk uranium series dating and thermoluminescence dating give evidence to the use of wood fires at the site of beeches pit suffolk 6 7 waterwheel technology was imported to the country by the romans with sites in ikenham and willowford in england being from the 2nd century ad 8 at the time of the compilation of the domesday book 1086 there were 5,624 watermills in england alone only 2 of which have not been located by modern archaeological surveys 9 later research estimates a less conservative number of 6,082 and it has been pointed out that this should be considered a minimum as the northern reaches of england were never properly recorded 10 in 1300 this number had risen to between 10,000 and 15,000 11 windmills first appeared in europe during the middle ages the earliest certain reference to a windmill in europe assumed to have been of the vertical type dates from 1185 in the former village of weedley in yorkshire which was located at the southern tip of the wold overlooking the humber estuary 12 the first electricity-generating wind turbine was a battery charging machine installed in july 1887 by scottish academic james blyth to light his holiday home in marykirk scotland 13 in 1878 the world s first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at cragside in northumberland england by william george armstrong it was used to power a single arc lamp in his art gallery 14 however almost all electricity generation thereafter was based on burning coal in 1964 coal accounted for 88 of electricity generation and oil was 11 15 the remainder was mostly supplied by hydroelectric power which continued to grow its share of electricity generation as coal struggled to meet demand the world s third pumped-storage hydroelectric power station the cruachan dam in argyll and bute scotland became fully operational in 1967 16 the central electricity generating board attempted to experiment with wind energy on the llŷn peninsula in wales during the 1950s but this was shelved after local opposition 15 renewable energy experienced a turning point in the 1970s with the 1973 oil crisis miners strike 1972 growing environmentalism and wind energy development in the united states exerting pressure on the government in 1974 the central policy review staff made the recommendation that ‘the first stage of a full technical and economic appraisal of harnessing wave power for electricity generation should be put in hand at once.’ wave power was seen to be the future of the nation s energy policy and solar wind and tidal schemes were dismissed as impractical nevertheless an alternative energy research centre was opened in harwell although it was criticised for favouring nuclear power by 1978 four wave energy generator prototypes had been designed which were later deemed too expensive the wave energy programme closed in the same year 15 during this period there was a large increase in installations of solar thermal collectors to provide hot water in 1986 southampton began pumping heat from the geothermal borehole through a district heating network over the years several combined heat and power chp engines and backup boilers for heating have been added along with absorption chillers and backupvapour compression machines for cooling 17 in 1987 a 3.7mw demonstration wind turbine on orkney began supplying electricity to homes the largest in britain at the time privatisation of the energy sector in 1989 caused direct governmental research funding to cease two years later the uk s first onshore windfarm was opened in delabole cornwall the farm consists of 10 turbines and produces enough energy for 2,700 homes this was followed by the uk s first offshore windfarm in north hoyle wales 18 the share of renewables in the country s electricity generation has risen from below 2 in 1990 to 14.9 in 2013 helped by subsidy and falling costs introduced on 1 april 2002 the renewables obligation requires all electricity suppliers who supply electricity to end consumers to supply a set portion of their electricity from eligible renewables sources a proportion that will increase each year until 2015 from a 3 requirement in 2002-2003 via 10.4 in 2010-2012 up to 15.4 by 2015-2016 the uk government announced in the 2006 energy review an additional target of 20 by 2020-21 for each eligible megawatt hour of renewable energy generated a tradable certificate called a renewables obligation certificate roc is issued by ofgem in 2007 the united kingdom government agreed to an overall european union target of generating 20 of the european union s energy supply from renewable sources by 2020 each european union member state was given its own allocated target for the united kingdom it is 15 this was formalised in january 2009 with the passage of the eu renewables directive as renewable heat and fuel production in the united kingdom are at extremely low bases renewableuk estimates that this will require 35–40 of the united kingdom s electricity to be generated from renewable sources by that date 19 to be met largely by 33–35 gw of installed wind capacity the 2008 climate change act consists of a commitment to reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 80 by 2050 on 1990 levels and an intermediate target reduction of 26 by 2020 the green deal is uk government policy launched by the department of energy and climate change on 1 october 2012 it

united kingdom and at the beginning of january 2015 wind power in the united kingdom consisted of 6,546 wind turbines with a total installed capacity of just under 12 gigawatts 7,950 megawatts of onshore capacity and 4,049 megawatts of offshore capacity 27 the united kingdom is ranked as the world s sixth largest producer of wind power having overtaken france and italy in 2012 28 polling of public opinion consistently shows strong support for wind power in the uk with nearly three quarters of the population agreeing with its use even for people living near onshore wind turbines wind power is expected to continue growing in the uk for the foreseeable future renewableuk estimates that more than 2 gw of capacity will be deployed per year for the next five years 29 within the uk wind power is the second largest source of renewable energy after biomass 3 2010 saw the completion of some significant projects in the uk wind industry with the gunfleet sands robin rigg 30 and thanet 31 offshore wind farms coming on stream over 1.1 gw of new wind power capacity was brought online during 2010 a 3 increase on 2009 there was a 38 drop in onshore installations to 503 mw compared with 815 mw in 2009 but there was a 230 increase in offshore installations with 653 mw installed compared with 285 mw in 2009 ocean power edit pb150 powerbuoy with peak-rated power output of 150 kw main article marine energy the islay limpet wave power device due to the island location of the uk the country has great potential for generating electricity from wave power and tidal power to date wave and tidal power have received very little money for development and consequently have not yet been exploited on a significant commercial basis due to doubts over their economic viability in the uk 32 the european marine energy centre in orkney operates a grid connected wave power scheme at billia croo outside stromness and a grid connected tidal test side in a narrow channel between the westray firth and stronsay firth 33 funding for the uk s first wave farm was announced by then scottish executive in february 2007 it will be the world s largest with a capacity of 3 mw generated by four pelamis machines and a cost of over 4 million pounds 34 in the south of scotland,investigations have taken place into a tidal power scheme involving the construction of a solway barage possibly located south of annan a wave farm project to harness wave power using the pb150 powerbuoy has been completed by ocean power technologies in scotland and is under development off cornwall at wave hub biofuels edit main article biofuel in the united kingdom gas from sewage and landfill biogas has already been exploited in some areas in 2004 it provided 129.3 gw·h up 690 from 1990 levels and was the uk s leading renewable energy source representing 39.4 of all renewable energy produced including hydro 35 the uk has committed to a target of 10.3 of renewable energy in transport to comply with the renewable energy directive of the european union but has not yet implemented legislation to meet this target other biofuels can provide a close-to-carbon-neutral energy source if locally grown in south america and asia the production of biofuels for export has in some cases resulted in significant ecological damage including the clearing of rainforest in 2004 biofuels provided 105.9 gw·h 38 of it wood this represented an increase of 500 from 1990 36 solar edit solar panels on the bedzed development in the london borough of sutton main article solar power in the united kingdom at the end of 2011 there were 230,000 solar power projects in the united kingdom 37 with a total installed generating capacity of 750 megawatts mw 38 by february 2012 the installed capacity had reached 1,000 mw 39 solar power use has increased very rapidly in recent years albeit from a small base as a result of reductions in the cost of photovoltaic pv panels and the introduction of a feed-in tariff fit subsidy in april 2010 37 in 2012 the government said that 4 million homes across the uk will be powered by the sun within eight years 40 representing 22,000 mw of installed solar power capacity by 2020 37 hydroelectric edit main article hydroelectricity in the united kingdom the dinorwig power station lower reservoir a 1,800 mw pumped-storage hydroelectric scheme in north wales and the largest hydroelectric power station in the uk as of 2012 hydroelectric power stations in the united kingdom accounted for 1.67 gw of installed electrical generating capacity being 1.9 of the uk s total generating capacity and 14 of uk s renewable energy generating capacity annual electricity production from such schemes is approximately 5,700 gwh being about 1.5 of the uk s total electricity production 41 there are also pumped-storage power stations in the uk these power stations are net consumers of electrical energy however they contribute to balancing the grid which can facilitate renewable generation elsewhere for example by soaking up surplus renewable output at off-peak times and release the energy when it is required geothermal power edit main article geothermal power in the united kingdom investigations into the exploitation of geothermal power in the united kingdom prompted by the 1973 oil crisis were abandoned as fuel prices fell only one scheme is operational in southampton in 2004 it was announced that a further scheme would be built to heat the uk s first geothermal energy model village near eastgate county durham 42 microgeneration edit microgeneration technologies are seen as having considerable potential by the government however the microgeneration strategy launched in march 2006 43 was seen as a disappointment by many commentators 44 microgeneration involves the local production of electricity by homes and businesses from low-energy sources including small scale wind turbines and solar electricity installations the climate change and sustainable energy act 2006 45 is expected to boost the number of microgeneration installations 46 however funding for grants under the low carbon building programme is proving insufficient to meet demand 47 with funds for march 2007 being spent in 75 minutes 48 fits feed-in-tariffs aka clean energy cashback were introduced from 1 april 2010 to support microgeneration of electricity the renewable heat incentive was introduced from 28 november 2011 to support microgeneration of heat from ground source heat pumps solar thermal panels and biomass boilers but only for non-domestic dwellings the government has plans to extend the rhi to domestic dwellings in 2013 the delay of introducing the rhi for renewable heat long after the subsidy for renewable electricity was introduced has dealt a savage blow to the renewable heat industries community energy systems edit sustainable community energy systems pioneered by woking borough council provide an integrated approach to using cogeneration renewables and other technologies to provide sustainable energy supplies to an urban community it is expected that the same approach will be developed in other towns and cities including london 49 highlands and islands community energy company based in inverness are active in developing community-owned and led initiatives in scotland 50 energy positive house was built in wales with £120,000 in july 2015 the future price is estimated as £100,000 the annual export of energy of building is higher than its own demand 51
