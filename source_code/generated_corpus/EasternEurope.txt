eastern europe wikipedia eastern europe from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search eastern europe geographic features of eastern europe eastern europe is the eastern part of the european continent there is no consensus as to the precise area it refers to partly because the term has a wide range of geopolitical geographical cultural and socioeconomic connotations there are almost as many definitions of eastern europe as there are scholars of the region 1 a related united nations paper adds that every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct 2 one definition describes eastern europe as a cultural and econo-cultural entity the region lying in europe with main characteristics consisting in byzantine orthodox and some turco-islamic influences 2 3 another definition was created during the cold war and used more or less synonymously with the term eastern bloc a similar definition names the formerly communist european states outside the soviet union as eastern europe 3 historians and social scientists increasingly view such definitions as outdated or relegating 4 5 6 7 8 but they are still heard in everyday speech and used for statistical purposes 9 10 11 definitions edit several definitions of eastern europe exist today but they often lack precision or are extremely general these definitions vary both across cultures and among experts even political scientists recently becoming more and more imprecise 12 geographical edit the ural mountains ural river and the caucasus mountains are the geographical land border of the eastern edge of europe in the west however the cultural and religious boundaries of eastern europe are subject to considerable overlap and most importantly have undergone historical fluctuations which make a precise definition of the western boundaries of eastern europe and the geographical midpoint of europe somewhat difficult international organisations edit un statistics division edit regions used for statistical processing purposes by the united nations statistics division northern europe western europe eastern europe southern europe the united nations statistics division developed a selection of geographical regions and groupings of countries and areas which are or may be used in compilation of statistics in this collection the following ten countries were classified as eastern europe 10 11 belarus bulgaria czech republic hungary moldova poland romania russia slovakia and ukraine the assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories by the united nations 13 the united nations definition encompasses most of the states which were once under the soviet union s realm of influence and were part of the warsaw pact other agencies of the united nations like unaids 14 unhcr 15 16 ilo 17 or unicef 18 divide

situation in europe during the cold war historical edit one view of the present boundaries of eastern europe came into being during the final stages of world war ii the area eventually came to encompass all the european countries which were under soviet influence countries which had communist governments in the postwar era 1945-1991 and neutral countries were classified by the nature of their political regimes the cold war increased the number of reasons for the division of europe into two parts along the borders of nato and warsaw pact states see the cold war section the economic organisation connecting the countries was the council for mutual economic assistance contemporary edit in recent years after the fall of the ussr a few political and economic organisations emerged in the region of eastern europe including the commonwealth of independent states cis and more recently the eurasian economic union commonwealth of independent states commonwealth of independent states free trade area eurasian economic union union state of russia and belarus baltic assembly guam cultural edit cultural view excludes from the definition of eastern europe states historically and culturally different constituting part of the so-called western world this could potentially refer to various formerly communist countries of central europe the baltics and the balkans which have

which specifies that all three are geographically in asia but have political and cultural connections to turkey and europe georgia has sought membership in nato and the eu the world factbook and

other former soviet states edit several other former soviet republics may be considered part of eastern europe russia is a transcontinental country where the western part is in eastern europe and the rest is in asia kazakhstan is a transcontinental country predominantly in asia with a relatively small section in europe ukraine belarus moldova central europe edit the term central europe is often used by historians to designate former holy roman empire and the polish-lithuanian commonwealth including modern-day belarus and ukraine and thus overlapping with eastern europe the following countries are labeled eastern european by some commentators and as central european by others 30 31 32 austria czech republic croatia 33 34 35 36 37 hungary poland slovakia slovenia most often placed in central europe but sometimes in southeastern europe 38 southeastern europe edit main articles southeast europe balkans and southern europe most southeastern european states did not belong to the eastern bloc save bulgaria romania and for a short time albania although some of them were represented in the cominform only some of them can be included in the classical former political definition of eastern europe some can be considered part of southern europe 10 however most can be characterized as belonging to south-eastern europe but some of them may also be included in central europe or eastern europe 39 albania belongs to southeastern europe bosnia and herzegovina bulgaria is in the central part of the balkans geographically belongs to southern southeastern europe and sometimes included in the north-eastern mediterranean but can also be included in eastern europe in the cold war cyprus is geographically situated in the eastern mediterranean off the coast of west asian mainland however due to its political cultural and historical ties to europe it is often regarded as part of southern and southeastern europe greece is a rather unusual case and may be included variously in western 40 southeastern 41 or southern europe 42 43 macedonia belongs to southeastern europe montenegro belongs to southeastern europe romania can be included in eastern europe in the cold war context but is commonly referred to as belonging to southeastern europe 44 or central europe 45 serbia is included in notions of southeastern southern and central europe turkey lies partially in southeastern europe only the region known as east thrace which constitutes 3 of the country s total land mass lies west of the dardanelles the sea of marmara and the bosphorus disputed states kosovo belongs to southeastern europe northern cyprus history edit classical antiquity and medieval origins edit further information history of the caucasus ancient kingdoms of the region included orontid armenia albania colchis and iberia these kingdoms were either from the start or later on incorporated into various iranian empires including the achaemenid persian parthian and sassanid persian empires 46 parts of the balkans and more northern areas were ruled by the achaemenid persians as well including thrace paeonia macedon and most of the black sea coastal regions of romania ukraine and russia 47 48 owing to the rivalry between parthian iran and rome and later byzantium and the sassanid persians the former would invade the region several times although it was never able to hold the region unlike the sassanids who ruled over most of the caucasus during their entire rule 49 the earliest known distinctions between east and west in europe originate in the history of the roman republic as the roman domain expanded a cultural and linguistic division appeared between the mainly greek speaking eastern provinces which had formed the highly urbanized hellenistic civilization in contrast the western territories largely adopted the latin language this cultural and linguistic division was eventually reinforced by the later political east–west division of the roman empire the division between these two spheres was enhanced during late antiquity and the middle ages by a number of events the western roman empire collapsed starting the early middle ages by contrast the eastern roman empire mostly known as the byzantine empire managed to survive and even to thrive for another 1,000 years the rise of the frankish empire in the west and in particular the great schism that formally divided eastern and western christianity enhanced the cultural and religious distinctiveness between eastern and western europe much of eastern europe was invaded and occupied by the mongols the conquest of the byzantine empire center of the eastern orthodox church by the ottoman empire in the 15th century and the gradual fragmentation of the holy roman empire which had replaced the frankish empire led to a change of the importance of roman catholic protestant vs eastern orthodox concept in europe armour points out that the cyrillic alphabet use is not a strict determinant for eastern europe where from croatia to poland and everywhere in between the latin alphabet is used 50 greece s status as the cradle of western civilization and an integral part of the western world in the political cultural and economic spheres has led to it being nearly always classified as belonging not to eastern but to southern and or western europe 51 during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries eastern europe enjoyed a relative high standard of living this period is also called the east-central european golden age of around 1600 52 interwar years edit a major result of the first world war was the breakup of the russian austro-hungarian and ottoman empires as well as partial losses to the german empire a surge of ethnic nationalism created a series of new states in eastern europe validated by the versailles treaty of 1919 poland was reconstituted after the partitions of the 1790s had divided it between germany austria and russia new countries included finland estonia latvia lithuania ukraine which was soon absorbed by the soviet union czechoslovakia and yugoslavia austria and hungary had much reduced boundaries romania bulgaria and albania likewise were independent all the countries were heavily rural with little industry and only a few urban centers nationalism was the dominant force but most of the countries had ethnic or religious minorities who felt threatened by majority elements nearly all became democratic in the 1920s but all of them except czechoslovakia and finland gave up democracy during the depression years of the 1930s in favor of autocratic or strong-man or single party states the new states were unable to form stable military alliances and one by one were too weak to stand up against nazi germany or

german and soviet armies sweeping back and forth with millions of jews killed by the nazis and millions of others killed by disease starvation and military action or executed after being deemed as politically dangerous 53 during the final stages of wwii the future of eastern europe was decided by the overwhelming power of the soviet red army as it swept the germans aside it did not reach yugoslavia and albania however finland was free but forced to be neutral in the upcoming cold war the region fell to soviet control and communist governments were imposed yugoslavia and albania had their own communist regimes the eastern bloc with the onset of the cold war in 1947 was mostly behind the western european countries in economic rebuilding and progress winston churchill in his famous sinews of peace address of march 5 1946 at westminster college in fulton missouri stressed the geopolitical impact of the iron curtain from stettin in the baltic to trieste in the adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the continent behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of central and eastern europe warsaw berlin prague vienna budapest belgrade bucharest and sofia the political borders of eastern europe were largely defined by the cold war from the end of world war ii to 1989 the iron curtain separated the members of the warsaw pact in red from the european

eastern bloc the soviet secret police the nkvd working in collaboration with local communists created secret police forces using leadership trained in moscow as soon as the red army had expelled the germans this new secret police arrived to arrest political enemies according to prepared lists the national communists then took power in a normally gradualist manner backed by the soviets in many but not all cases they took control of the interior ministries which controlled the local police they confiscated and redistributed farmland next the soviets and their agents took control of the mass media especially radio as well as the education system third the communists seized control of or replaced the organizations of civil society such as church groups sports youth groups trade unions farmers organizations and civic organizations finally they engaged in large scale ethnic cleansing moving ethnic minorities far away often with high loss of life after a year or two the communists took control of private businesses and monitored the media and churches for a while cooperative non-communist parties were tolerated the communists had a natural reservoir of popularity in that they had destroyed hitler and the nazi invaders their goal was to guarantee long-term working-class solidarity 54 55 eastern europe after 1945 usually meant all the european countries liberated and then occupied by the soviet army it included the german democratic republic also known as east germany formed by the soviet occupation zone of germany all the countries in eastern europe adopted communist modes of control these countries were officially independent from the soviet union but the practical extent of this independence – except in yugoslavia albania and to some extent romania – was quite limited under pressure from stalin these nations rejected grants from the american marshall plan instead they participated in the molotov plan which later evolved into the comecon council for mutual economic assistance when nato was created in 1949 most countries of eastern europe became members of the opposing warsaw pact forming a geopolitical concept that became known as the eastern bloc following the disappearance of the iron curtain in 1989 the political situation changed and some of the former members of the warsaw pact gradually joined nato current members candidate countries promised invitation membership not goal undeclared intent first and foremost was the soviet union which included the modern-day territories of russia lithuania latvia estonia belarus ukraine and moldova other countries dominated by the soviet union were the german democratic republic people s republic of poland czechoslovak socialist republic people s republic of hungary people s republic of bulgaria and socialist republic of romania the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia sfry formed after wwii and before its later dismemberment was not a member of the warsaw pact it was a founding member of the non-aligned movement an organization created in an attempt to avoid being assigned to either the nato or warsaw pact blocs the movement was demonstratively independent from both the soviet union and the western bloc for most of the cold war period allowing yugoslavia and its other members to act as a business and political mediator between the blocs the socialist people s republic of albania broke with the soviet union in the early 1960s as a result of the sino-soviet split aligning itself instead with china albania formally left the warsaw pact in september 1968 after the suppression of the prague spring when china established diplomatic relations with the united states in 1978 albania also broke away from china albania and especially yugoslavia were not unanimously appended to the eastern bloc as they were neutral for a large part of the cold war period since 1989 edit 2004-2007 eu enlargements — cold war iron curtain existing members new members in
