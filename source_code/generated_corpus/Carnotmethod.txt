carnot method wikipedia carnot method from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the carnot method is an allocation procedure for dividing up fuel input primary energy end energy in joint production processes that generate two or more energy products in one process e.g cogeneration or trigeneration it is also suited to allocate other streams such as co 2 emissions or variable costs the potential to generate mechanical or electrical work exergy is used as the distribution key for heat this potential can be assessed the carnot efficiency thus the carnot method is a form of an exergetic allocation method it uses mean heat grid temperatures at the output of the process as a calculation basis the main application area of this method is cogeneration but it can also be applied to other processes generating a joint products such as a chiller generating cold and producing waste heat which could be used for low temperature heat demand the carnot method s advantage is that no external reference values are required to allocate the input to the different output streams only endogenous process parameters are needed thus the allocation results remain unbiased of assumptions or external reference values that are open for discussion fuel allocation factor edit the fuel share a el which is needed to generate the combined product electrical energy w work and a th

efficiency factor which describes the quantity of usable end energies the quality of energy transformation according to the entropy law is also important with rising entropy exergy declines exergy does not only consider energy but also energy quality it can be considered a product of both therefore any energy transformation should also be assessed according to its exergetic efficiciency or loss ratios the quality of the product thermal energy is fundamentally determined by the mean temperature level at which this heat is delivered hence the exergetic efficiency η x describes how much of the fuel s potential to generate physical work remains in the joint energy products with cogeneration the result is the following relation η x,total η el η c × η th the allocation with the carnot method

the domain of primary energy or fuel costs or emissions etc evaluation of the input evaluation of the output f i × i f 1 × o 1 f 2 × o 2 the factor for the input f i and the quantities of i o 1 and o 2 are known an equation with two unknowns f 1 and f 2 has to be solved which is possible with a lot of adequate tuples as second equation the physical transformation of product o 1 in o 2 and vice versa is used o 1 η 21 × o 2 η 21 is the transformation factor from o 2 into o 1 the inverse 1 η 21 η 12 describes the backward transformation a reversible transformation is assumed in order not to favour any of the two directions because of the exhangeability of o 1 and o 2 the assessment of the two sides of the equation above with the two factors f 1 and f 2 should therefore result in an equivalent outcome output o 2 evaluated with f 2 shall be the same as the amount of o 1 generated from o 2 and evaluated with f 1 f 1 × η 21 × o 2 f 2 × o 2 if we put this into the first equation we see the following steps f i × i f 1 × o 1 f 1 × η 21 × o 2 f i × i f 1 × o 1 η 21 × o 2 f i f 1 × o 1 i η 21 × o 2 i f i f 1 × η 1 η 21 × η 2 f 1 f i η 1 η 21 × η 2 or respectively f 2 η 21 × f i η 1
