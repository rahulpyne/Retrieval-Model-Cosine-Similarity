agriculture and agronomy portal v t e permaculture is a system of agricultural and social design principles centered on simulating or directly utilizing the patterns and features observed in natural ecosystems permaculture was developed and the term coined by bill mollison and david holmgren in 1978 1 it has many branches that include but are not limited to ecological design ecological engineering environmental design construction and integrated water resources management that develops sustainable architecture and regenerative and self-maintained habitat and agricultural systems modeled from natural ecosystems 2 3 mollison has said permaculture is a philosophy of working with rather than against nature of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless labor and of looking at plants and animals in all their functions rather than treating any area as a single product system 4 history edit in 1929 joseph russell smith took up an antecedent term as the subtitle for tree crops a permanent agriculture a book in which he summed up his long experience experimenting with fruits and nuts as crops for human food and animal feed 5 smith saw the world as an inter-related whole and suggested mixed systems of trees and crops underneath this book inspired many individuals intent on making agriculture more sustainable such as toyohiko kagawa who pioneered forest farming in japan in the 1930s 6 the definition of permanent agriculture as that which can be sustained indefinitely was supported by australian p a yeomans in his 1964 book water for every farm yeomans introduced an observation-based approach to land use in australia in the 1940s and the keyline design as a way of managing the supply and distribution of water in the 1950s stewart brand ’s works were an early influence noted by holmgren 7 other early influences include ruth stout and esther deans who pioneered no-dig gardening and masanobu fukuoka who in the late 1930s in japan began advocating no-till orchards gardens and natural farming 8 bill mollison in january 2008 in the late 1960s bill mollison and david holmgren started developing ideas about stable agricultural systems on the southern australian island state of tasmania this was a result of the danger of the rapidly growing use of industrial-agricultural methods in their view 9 these methods were highly dependent on non-renewable resources and were additionally poisoning land and water reducing biodiversity and removing billions of tons of topsoil from previously fertile landscapes a design approach called permaculture was their response and was first made public with the publication of their book permaculture one in 1978 10 by the early 1980s the concept had broadened from agricultural systems design towards sustainable human habitats after permaculture one mollison further refined and developed the ideas by designing hundreds of permaculture sites and writing more detailed books notably permaculture a designers manual mollison lectured in over 80 countries and taught his two-week permaculture design course pdc to many hundreds of students citation needed mollison encouraged graduates to become teachers themselves and set up their own institutes and demonstration sites this multiplier effect was critical to permaculture’s rapid expansion 11 core tenets and principles of design edit the three core tenets of permaculture are 12 13 14 care for the earth provision for all life systems to continue and multiply this is the first principle because without a healthy earth humans cannot flourish care for the people provision for people to access those resources necessary for their existence return of surplus reinvesting surpluses back into the system to provide for the first two ethics this includes returning waste back into the system to recycle into usefulness 15 the third ethic is sometimes referred to as fair share to reflect that each of us should take no more than what we need before we reinvest the surplus permaculture design emphasizes patterns of landscape function and species assemblies it determines where these elements should be placed so they can provide maximum benefit to the local environment the central concept of permaculture is maximizing useful connections between components and synergy of the final design the focus of permaculture therefore is not on each separate element but rather on the relationships created among elements by the way they are placed together the whole becoming greater than the sum of its parts permaculture design therefore seeks to minimize waste human labor and energy input by building systems with maximal benefits between design elements to achieve a high level of synergy permaculture designs evolve over time by taking into account these relationships and elements and can become extremely complex systems that produce a high density of food and materials with minimal input 16 the design principles which are the conceptual foundation of permaculture were derived from the science of systems ecology and study of pre-industrial examples of sustainable land use permaculture draws from several disciplines including organic farming agroforestry integrated farming sustainable development and applied ecology 17 permaculture has been applied most commonly to the design of housing and landscaping integrating techniques such as agroforestry natural building and rainwater harvesting within the context of permaculture design principles and theory theory edit twelve design principles edit twelve permaculture design principles articulated by david holmgren in his permaculture principles and pathways beyond sustainability 18 observe and interact by taking time to engage with nature we can design solutions that suit our particular situation catch and store energy by developing systems that collect resources at peak abundance we can use them in times of need obtain a yield ensure that you are getting truly useful rewards as part of the work that you are doing apply self-regulation and accept feedback we need to discourage inappropriate activity to ensure that systems can continue to function well use and value renewable resources and services make the best use of nature s abundance to reduce our consumptive behavior and dependence on non-renewable resources produce no waste by valuing and making use of all the resources that are available to us nothing goes to waste design from patterns to details by stepping back we can observe patterns in nature and society these can form the backbone of our designs with the details filled in as we go integrate rather than segregate by putting the right things in the right place relationships develop between those things and they work together to support each other use small and slow solutions small and slow systems are easier to maintain than big ones making better use of local resources and producing more sustainable outcomes use and value diversity diversity reduces vulnerability to a variety of threats and takes advantage of the unique nature of the environment in which it resides use edges and value the marginal the interface between things is where the most interesting events take place these are often the most valuable diverse and productive elements in the system creatively use and respond to change we can have a positive impact on inevitable change by carefully observing and then intervening at the right time layers edit suburban permaculture garden in sheffield uk with different layers of vegetation layers are one of the tools used to design functional ecosystems that are both sustainable and of direct benefit to humans a mature ecosystem has a huge number of relationships between its component parts trees understory ground cover soil fungi insects and animals because plants grow to different heights a diverse community of life is able to grow in a relatively small space as the vegetation occupies different layers there are generally seven recognized layers in a food forest although some practitioners also include fungi as an eighth layer 19 the canopy the tallest trees in the system large trees dominate but typically do not saturate the area i.e there exist patches barren of trees understory layer trees that revel in the dappled light under the canopy shrub layer a diverse layer of woody perennials of limited height includes most berry bushes herbaceous layer plants in this layer die back to the ground every winter if winters are cold enough that is they do not produce woody stems as the shrub layer does many culinary and medicinal herbs are in this layer a large variety of beneficial plants fall into this layer may be annuals biennials or perennials soil surface groundcover there is some overlap with the herbaceous layer and the groundcover layer however plants in this layer grow much closer to the ground grow densely to fill bare patches of soil and often can tolerate some foot traffic cover crops retain soil and lessen erosion along with green manures that add nutrients and organic matter to the soil especially nitrogen rhizosphere root layers within the soil the major components of this layer are the soil and the organisms that live within it such as plant roots including root crops such as potatoes and other edible tubers fungi insects nematodes worms etc vertical layer climbers or vines such as runner beans and lima beans vine varieties 19 20 guilds edit there are many forms of guilds including guilds of plants with similar functions that could interchange within an ecosystem but the most common perception is that of a mutual support guild such a guild is a group of species where each provides a unique set of diverse functions that work in conjunction or harmony mutual support guilds are groups of plants animals insects etc that work well together some plants may be grown for food production some have tap roots that draw nutrients up from deep in the soil some are nitrogen-fixing legumes some attract beneficial insects and others repel harmful insects when grouped together in a mutually beneficial arrangement these plants form a guild see dave jacke s work on edible forest gardens for more information on other guilds specifically resource-partitioning and community-function guilds 21 22 23 edge effect edit the edge effect in ecology is the effect of the juxtaposition or placing side by side of contrasting environments on an ecosystem permaculturists argue that where vastly differing systems meet there is an intense area of productivity and useful connections an example of this is the coast where the land and the sea meet there is a particularly rich area that meets a disproportionate percentage of human and animal needs so this idea is played out in permacultural designs by using spirals in the herb garden or creating ponds that have wavy undulating shorelines rather than a simple circle or oval thereby increasing the amount of edge for a given area citation needed zones edit permaculture zones 0-5 zones are a way of intelligently organizing design elements in a human environment on the basis of the frequency of human use and plant or animal needs frequently manipulated or harvested elements of the design are located close to the house in zones 1 and 2 less frequently used or manipulated elements and elements that benefit from isolation such as wild species are farther away zones are about positioning things appropriately and are numbered from 0 to 5 24 page needed zone 0 the house or home center here permaculture principles would be applied in terms of aiming to reduce energy and water needs harnessing natural resources such as sunlight and generally creating a harmonious sustainable environment in which to live and work zone 0 is an informal designation which is not specifically defined in bill mollison ’s book zone 1 the zone nearest to the house the location for those elements in the system that require frequent attention or that need to be visited often such as salad crops herb plants soft fruit like strawberries or raspberries greenhouse and cold frames propagation area worm compost bin for kitchen waste etc raised beds are often used in zone 1 in urban areas zone 2 this area is used for siting perennial plants that require less frequent maintenance such as occasional weed control or pruning including currant bushes and orchards pumpkins sweet potato etc this would also be a good place for beehives larger scale composting bins etc zone 3 the area where main-crops are grown both for domestic use and for trade purposes after establishment care and maintenance required are fairly minimal provided mulches and similar things are used such as watering or weed control maybe once a week zone 4 a semi-wild area this zone is mainly used for forage and collecting wild food as well as production of timber for construction or firewood zone 5 a wilderness area there is no human intervention in zone 5 apart from the observation of natural ecosystems and cycles through this zone we build up a natural reserve of bacteria moulds and insects that can aid the zones above it 25 people and permaculture edit permaculture uses observation of nature to create regenerative systems and the place where this has been most visible has been on the landscape there has been a growing awareness though that firstly there is the need to pay more attention to the peoplecare ethic as it is often the dynamics of people that can interfere with projects and secondly that the principles of permaculture can be used as effectively to create vibrant healthy and productive people and communities as they have been in landscapes domesticated animals edit domesticated animals are often incorporated into site design 26 common practices edit agroforestry edit agroforestry is an integrated approach of using the interactive benefits from combining trees and shrubs with crops and or livestock it combines agricultural and forestry technologies to create more diverse productive profitable healthy and sustainable land-use systems 27 in agroforestry systems trees or shrubs are intentionally used within agricultural systems or non-timber forest products are cultured in forest settings citation needed forest gardening is a term permaculturalists use to describe systems designed to mimic natural forests forest gardens like other permaculture designs incorporate processes and relationships that the designers understand to be valuable in natural ecosystems the terms forest garden and food forest are used interchangeably in the permaculture literature numerous permaculturists are proponents of forest gardens such as graham bell patrick whitefield dave jacke eric toensmeier and geoff lawton bell started building his forest garden in 1991 and wrote the book the permaculture garden in 1995 whitefield wrote the book how to make a forest garden in 2002 jacke and toensmeier co-authored the two volume book set edible forest gardening in 2005 and lawton presented the film establishing a food forest in 2008 16 28 29 tree gardens such as kandyan tree gardens in south and southeast asia are often hundreds of years old whether they derived initially from experiences of cultivation and forestry as is the case in agroforestry or whether they derived from an understanding of forest ecosystems as is the case for permaculture systems is not self-evident many studies of these systems especially those that predate the term permaculture consider these systems to be forms of agroforestry permaculturalists who include existing and ancient systems of polycropping with woody species as examples of food forests may obscure the distinction between permaculture and agroforestry food forests and agroforestry are parallel approaches that sometimes lead to similar designs hügelkultur edit hügelkultur is the practice of burying large volumes of wood to increase soil water retention the porous structure of wood acts as a sponge when decomposing underground during the rainy season masses of buried wood can absorb enough water to sustain crops through the dry season 30 this technique has been used by permaculturalists sepp holzer toby hemenway paul wheaton and masanobu fukuoka 31 32 natural building edit a natural building involves a range of building systems and materials that place major emphasis on sustainability ways of achieving sustainability through natural building focus on durability and the use of minimally processed plentiful or renewable resources as well as those that while recycled or salvaged produce healthy living environments and maintain indoor air quality the basis of natural building is the need to lessen the environmental impact of buildings and other supporting systems without sacrificing comfort health or aesthetics to be more sustainable natural building uses primarily abundantly available renewable reused or recycled materials in addition to relying on natural building materials the emphasis on the architectural design is heightened the orientation of a building the utilization of local climate and site conditions the emphasis on natural ventilation through design fundamentally lessen operational costs and positively impact the environment building compactly and minimizing the ecological footprint is common as are on-site handling of energy acquisition on-site water capture alternate sewage treatment and water reuse citation needed rainwater harvesting edit rainwater harvesting is the accumulating and storing of rainwater for reuse before it reaches the aquifer 33 it has been used to provide drinking water water for livestock water for irrigation as well as other typical uses rainwater collected from the roofs of houses and local institutions can make an important contribution to the availability of drinking water it can supplement the subsoil water level and increase urban greenery water collected from the ground sometimes from areas which are especially prepared for this purpose is called stormwater harvesting citation needed greywater is wastewater generated from domestic activities such as laundry dishwashing and bathing which can be recycled on-site for uses such as landscape irrigation and constructed wetlands greywater is largely sterile but not potable drinkable greywater differs from water from the toilets which is designated sewage or blackwater to indicate it contains human waste blackwater is septic or otherwise toxic and cannot easily be reused there are however continuing efforts to make use of blackwater or human waste the most notable is for composting through a process known as humanure a combination of the words human and manure additionally the methane in humanure can be collected and used similar to natural gas as a fuel such as for heating or cooking and is commonly referred to as biogas biogas can be harvested from the human waste and the remainder still used as humanure some of the simplest forms of humanure use include a composting toilet or an outhouse or dry bog surrounded by trees that are heavy feeders which can be coppiced for wood fuel this process eliminates the use of a standard toilet with plumbing citation needed sheet mulching edit in agriculture and gardening mulch is a protective cover placed over the soil any material or combination can be used as mulch such as stones leaves cardboard wood chips gravel etc. though in permaculture mulches of organic material are the most common because they perform more functions these include absorbing rainfall reducing evaporation providing nutrients increasing organic matter in the soil feeding and creating habitat for soil organisms suppressing weed growth and seed germination moderating diurnal temperature swings protecting against frost and reducing erosion sheet mulching is an agricultural no-dig gardening technique that attempts to mimic natural processes occurring within forests sheet mulching mimics the leaf cover that is found on forest floors when deployed properly and in combination with other permacultural principles it can generate healthy productive and low maintenance ecosystems 34 35 page needed sheet mulch serves as a nutrient bank storing the nutrients contained in organic matter and slowly making these nutrients available to plants as the organic matter slowly and naturally breaks down it also improves the soil by attracting and feeding earthworms slaters and many other soil micro-organisms as well as adding humus earthworms till the soil and their worm castings are among the best fertilizers and soil conditioners sheet mulching can be used to reduce or eliminate undesirable plants by starving them of light and can be more advantageous than using herbicide or other methods of control citation needed intensive rotational grazing edit grazing has long been blamed for much of the destruction we see in the environment however it has been shown that when grazing is modeled after nature the opposite effect can be seen 36 37 also known as cell grazing managed intensive rotational grazing mirg is a system of grazing in which ruminant and non-ruminant herds and or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh pasture range or forest with the intent to maximize the quality and quantity of forage growth this disturbance is then followed by a period of rest which allows new growth mirg can be used with cattle sheep goats pigs chickens rabbits geese turkeys ducks and other animals depending on the natural ecological community that is being mimicked sepp holzer and joel salatin have shown how the disturbance caused by the animals can be the spark needed to start ecological succession or prepare ground for planting allan savory s holistic management technique has been likened to a permaculture approach to rangeland management 38 39 one variation on mirg that is gaining rapid popularity is called eco-grazing often used to either control invasives or re-establish native species in eco-grazing the primary purpose of the animals is to benefit the environment and the animals can be but are not necessarily used for meat milk or fiber 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 keyline design edit keyline design is a technique for maximizing beneficial use of water resources of a piece of land developed in australia by farmer and engineer p a yeomans the keyline refers to a specific topographic feature linked to water flow which is used in designing the drainage system of the site 47 fruit tree management edit some proponents of permaculture advocate no or limited pruning one advocate of this approach is sepp holzer who used the method in connection with hügelkultur berms he has successfully grown several varieties of fruiting trees at altitudes approximately 9,000 feet 2,700 m far above their normal altitude temperature and snow load ranges he notes that the hügelkultur berms kept and or generated enough heat to allow the roots to survive during alpine winter conditions the point of having unpruned branches he notes was that the longer more naturally formed branches bend over under the snow load until they touched the ground thus forming a natural arch against snow loads that would break a shorter pruned branch citation needed masanobu fukuoka as part of early experiments on his family farm in japan experimented with no-pruning methods noting that he ended up killing many fruit trees by simply letting them go which made them become convoluted and tangled and thus unhealthy 48 49 page needed then he realised this is the difference between natural-form fruit trees and the process of change of tree form that results from abandoning previously-pruned unnatural fruit trees 48 50 page needed he concluded that the trees should be raised all their lives without pruning so they form healthy and efficient branch patterns that follow their natural inclination this is part of his implementation of the tao philosophy of wú wéi translated in part as no-action against nature and he described it as no unnecessary pruning nature farming or do-nothing farming of fruit trees distinct from non-intervention or literal no-pruning he ultimately achieved yields comparable to or exceeding standard intensive practices of using pruning and chemical fertilisation 48 50 page needed 51 trademark and copyright issues edit there has been contention over who if anyone controls legal rights to the word permaculture is it trademarked or copyrighted and if so who holds the legal rights to the use of the word for a long time bill mollison claimed to have copyrighted the word and his books said on the copyright page the contents of this book and the word permaculture are copyright these statements were largely accepted at face-value within the permaculture community however copyright law does not protect names ideas concepts systems or methods of doing something it only protects the expression or the description of an idea not the idea itself eventually mollison acknowledged that he was mistaken and that no copyright protection existed for the word permaculture 52 in 2000 mollison s us based permaculture institute sought a service mark a form of trademark for the word permaculture when used in educational services such as conducting classes seminars or workshops 53 the service mark would have allowed mollison and his two permaculture institutes one in the us and one in australia to set enforceable guidelines regarding how permaculture could be taught and who could teach it particularly with relation to the pdc despite the fact that he had instituted a system of certification of teachers to teach the pdc in 1993 the service mark failed and was abandoned in 2001 also in 2001 mollison applied for trademarks in australia for the terms permaculture design course 54 and permaculture design 54 these applications were both withdrawn in 2003 in 2009 he sought a trademark for permaculture a designers’ manual 54 and introduction to permaculture 54 the names of two of his books these applications were withdrawn in 2011 there has never been a trademark for the word permaculture in australia 54 criticisms edit general criticisms edit in 2011 owen hablutzel argued that permaculture has yet to gain a large amount of specific mainstream scientific acceptance and that the sensitiveness to being perceived and accepted on scientific terms is motivated in part by a desire for permaculture to expand and become increasingly relevant in his books sustainable freshwater aquaculture and farming in ponds and dams nick romanowski expresses the view that the presentation of aquaculture in bill mollison s books is unrealistic and misleading 55 agroforestry edit greg williams argues that forests cannot be more productive than farmland because the net productivity of forests decline as they mature due to ecological succession 56 proponents of permaculture respond that this is true only if one compares data between woodland forest and climax vegetation but not when comparing farmland vegetation with woodland forest citation needed for example ecological succession generally results in a forest s productivity rising after its establishment only until it reaches the woodland state 67 tree cover before declining until full maturity 16
