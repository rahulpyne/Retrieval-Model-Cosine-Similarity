renewable energy in hungary wikipedia renewable energy in hungary from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search hungary is a member of the european union and thus takes part in the eu strategy to increase its share of the renewable energy the eu has adopted the 2009 renewable energy directive which included a 20 renewable energy target by 2020 for the eu 1 by 2030 wind should produce in average 26-35 of the eu s electricity and save europe €56 billion a year in avoided fuel costs 2 the national authors of hungary forecast is 14.7 renewables in gross energy consumption by 2020 exceeding their 13 binding target by 1.7 percentage points hungary is the eu country with the smallest forecast penetration of renewables of the electricity demand in 2020 namely only 11 including biomass 6 and wind power 3 in 2015 10,5 of the gross hungarian electricity production came from renewables 52 of that amount was from biomass 22 was from wind 7 was from hydroenergy and 3 was from solar 3 wind farm near mosonszolnok wind power edit main article wind power in hungary the national forecast included 400 mw of new wind power capacity between 2010-2020 ewea’s 2009 forecast expected hungary to reach 1.2 gw of installed wind capacity in this time 1 in the end of 2010 wind power capacity was 295 mw 4 however since 2010 no further wind energy tenders were accepted in 2016 the hungarian government banned the installation of new wind energy capacities with administrative measures 5 the current capacity of wind power in hungary is 329 mw eu and hungary wind energy capacity mw 6 7 8 9 no country 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 eu-27 105,696 93,957 84,074 74,767 64,712 56,517 48,069 40,511 34,383 28,599 23,159 17,315 12,887 9,678 6,453 17 hungary 329 329 295 201 127 65 61 17 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 solar power edit main article solar power in hungary the hungarian solar power generation is rapidly advancing although from a small basis.by the end of 2015 hungary had installed more than 110 megawatt mw of photovoltaics the country s capacity is expected to double in 2016 10 hydro power edit kisköre dam located in the carpathian basin hungary has limited access to hydroelectricity since the unfortunate case of the gabčíkovo–nagymaros dams project the building of hydroelectric dams is extremely unpopular in the hungarian society the existing croatian plans of building new dams on the shared sections of the river drava is rejected by the hungarian government 11 hungary s two largest hydroelectric dams tiszalök kisköre are built on the river tisza with 12,5 mw and 28 mw capacities respectively the remaining power stations are usually former mills transformed to small hydroelectric dams geothermal power edit geothermal energy is widely used in hungary for the heating of homes and industrial areas the first power plant using geothermal energy is being built in tura with the capacity of 2,6 mw its operation is expected to start in 2017 12
