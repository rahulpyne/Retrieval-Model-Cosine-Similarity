energy headquarters helsinki finland area served international staff 3 volunteers over 100 website www ekoenergy org ekoenergy is an ecolabel for electricity it is a not-for-profit initiative of the ekoenergy network a group of more than 40 environmental organizations from 30 countries 1 ekoenergy started in 2013 in europe its secretariat is based in helsinki 2 nowadays ekoenergy is the only international ecolabel for renewable electricity it is available all over the world and its material is available in more than 30 languages 3 governance edit every member organization all not-for-profit organisations appoints one person to the ekoenergy board the network’s highest governing authority the board takes decisions in consultation with the advisory group which consist of

e.g ekoénergie in france 5 ekoenergie in germany 6 or ekoenergia in finland 7 criteria of the ecolabel edit only electricity from renewable sources can be sold as ekoenergy but ekoenergy is more than just green electricity ekoenergy also sets criteria for the following aspects 8 consumer information consumers get information about where and how the electricity has been produced sustainability ekoenergy takes into account the impacts of electricity production on ecosystem services habitats and the biodiversity of species firstly it does this by excluding the most environmentally degrading and problematic electricity production methods secondly it finances river restoration through an environmental fund climate per every mwh sold minimum 10 euro cents will be paid into the ekoenergy climate fund tracking of the electricity the criteria are based on the european best practice and on the recommendations of re-diss eped auditing and verification all ekoenergy claims are verified by independent auditors users of the label edit well known sellers of ekoenergy certified electricity include fortum 9 vattenfall 10 ekosähkö 11 and gesternova 12 also sellers of electricity tracking certificates can help consumers to get ekoenergy e.g ecohz 13 and south pole group 14 a full list of licensed sellers can be found on ekoenergy’s website http www.ekoenergy.org buying-ekoenergy licensees an increasing number of ekoenergy consumers uses the label in its own communication 15 e.g otava printing 16 and saimaan juomatehdas 17 results edit solar project in tanzania climate fund edit for each mwh of ekoenergy sold the seller pays a minimum of €0.10 to ekoenergy’s climate fund this money is used to finance climate projects that would not have happened without the contributions these projects are managed by experienced organisations all projects are selected in an open process with sellers buyers and independent experts actively involved 18 examples of funded projects solar panels for tanzanian schools 19 solar panels for schools in cameroon 20 river restorations ekoenergy’s environmental fund and nature conservation edit whenever hydropower is sold with the ekoenergy label €0.10 mwh go to the environmental fund to finance river restoration projects 21 examples of earlier funded projects murronjoki river restoration finland 22 norina river restoration latvia 23 ekoenergy mentioned in other environmental standards edit leed edit the european versions of the leed standard explicitly recommend the use of ekoenergy labelled electricity 24 buildings aiming at leed certification can get extra points if the electricity used in that building is ekoenergy certified the text “leed 2009 bd c supplemental reference guide with alternative compliance paths for europe” 25 gives ekoenergy the same status as green-e certified recs in the us they write the ekoenergy electricity certification scheme represents the best available pan-european option for the sustainable and additional consumption of renewable electricity within europe ekoenergy certifies renewable electricity that goes beyond the regulations of european directives and national governments of europe greenhouse gas protocol edit the greenhouse gas protocol is a worldwide standard for carbon accounting it is a joint product of the world resources institute and the world business council for sustainable development in january 2015 the secretariat of the greenhouse gas protocol published the scope 2 guidance which gave advice about carbon accounting the guidance refers to ekoenergy several times chapter 11 which encourages companies to go one step further refers to ekoenergy’s climate fund 26 27 cdp edit cdp works with 5000 of the largest corporations in the world to help them calculate their carbon emissions and to help them develop effective carbon emission reduction strategies on page 15 and 16 of its technical notes for accounting of scope 2 emissions i.e emissions related to the production of purchased electricity cdp explains how companies can do more “ecolabels are a way for companies to do more with their purchases ekoenergy mentioned by the ghg protocol scope 2 guidance is such an option it is a mark of quality which comes on top of tracking certificates electricity sold with the ekoenergy label fulfills strict environmental criteria and raises funds for new renewable energy projects involvement transparency and ‘deeds not words’ are important principles of ekoenergy’s work.” 28
