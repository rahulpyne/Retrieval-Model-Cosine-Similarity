momentum in germany the desire to continue and develop classical styles sprouted 3 from 1904 until around 1955 the heimatschutz style prospered in germany which focused on vernacular traditions and can be roughly translated to cultural protection style examples of this early new classical style are the hamburg museum the prinzipalmarkt in münster and the market square of freudenstadt after heavy allied bombing of germany in world war ii architects such as adolf abel roderich fick konstanty gutschow werner march paul schmitthenner julius schulte-frohlinde and rudolf wolters assisted in the

in order to differentiate themselves from art history phd programs where architectural historians had previously trained in the us mit and cornell were the first created in the mid-1970s followed by columbia berkeley and princeton among the founders of new architectural history programs were bruno zevi at the institute for the history of architecture in venice stanford anderson and henry millon at mit alexander tzonis at the architectural association anthony vidler at princeton manfredo tafuri at the university of venice kenneth frampton at columbia university and werner oechslin and kurt

influential postmodernist architects such as charles moore robert venturi 10 and michael graves who used classical elements as ironic motifs in order to criticize modernism s sterility a broad spectrum of more than two dozen architects theorists and historians presented other alternatives to modernism 11 among them were several serious new classical architects who saw classicism as a legitimate mode of architectural expression several of whom would later become driehaus prize laureates including some such as thomas beeby and robert a.m stern who practice both in post modern as well as classical modes some postmodernist firms such as stern and albert righter tittman fully moved from postmodern design to new interpretations of traditional architecture 9 thomas gordon smith

sustainable architecture fundamental tenets of the new classicism is that it is not limited to neoclassical architecture and that classical is not a style in itself but a way of elevating the art of building to the art of architecture 24 a classical building uses imitation to express its tectonic truth which is not the same as the facts of its construction and finds its beauty not in originality and style but in the handling of the traditional forms that have always been its vehicles classical buildings also always account for the differences between the public and the private realms in addressing the urban and rural conditions where they are built new classical architects also emphasize the awareness of sustainability the aim is to create long-lasting well-crafted buildings of great quality with an efficient use of natural resources 25 education edit while modernist teaching remains dominant at universities and architecture faculties around the world some institutions focus
