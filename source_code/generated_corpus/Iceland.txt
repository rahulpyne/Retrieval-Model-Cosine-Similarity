populated country in europe 7 the capital and largest city is reykjavík reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population iceland is volcanically and geologically active the interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields mountains and glaciers while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands iceland is warmed by the gulf stream and has a temperate climate despite a high latitude just outside the arctic circle its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate according to landnámabók the settlement of iceland began in the year 874 ce when the norwegian chieftain ingólfr arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island 8 in the following centuries norwegians and to a lesser extent other scandinavians immigrated to iceland bringing with them thralls of gaelic origin the island was governed as an independent commonwealth under the althing one of the world s oldest functioning legislative assemblies following a period of civil strife iceland acceded to norwegian rule in the 13th century in 1814 it came under the rule of denmark during which a distinct icelandic national identity emerged this culminated in independence in 1918 and the founding of a republic in 1944 until the 20th century iceland relied largely on subsistence fishing and agriculture and was among the poorest in europe industrialisation of the fisheries and marshall plan aid following world war ii brought prosperity and iceland became one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world in 1994 it became a part of the european economic area which further diversified the economy into sectors such as finance biotechnology and manufacturing iceland has a market economy with relatively low taxes compared to other oecd countries 9 it maintains a nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens 10 iceland ranks high in economic political and social stability and equality in 2013 it was ranked as the 13th most-developed country in the world by the united nations human development index 6 iceland runs almost completely on renewable energy affected by the ongoing worldwide financial crisis the nation s entire banking system systemically failed in october 2008 leading to a severe depression substantial political unrest the icesave dispute and the institution of capital controls many bankers were jailed 11 and the economy has made a significant recovery in large part due to a surge in tourism 12 13 14 icelandic culture is founded upon the nation s scandinavian heritage most icelanders are descendants of germanic and gaelic settlers icelandic

stayed over winter and built a house in húsavík garðar departed the following summer but one of his men náttfari decided to stay behind with two slaves náttfari settled in what is now known as náttfaravík and he and his slaves became the first permanent residents of iceland 19 20 the norwegian-norse chieftain ingólfr arnarson built his homestead in present-day reykjavík in the year 874 ingólfr was followed by many other emigrant settlers largely scandinavians and their thralls many of whom were irish or scottish 21 by 930 most arable land on the island had been claimed the althing a legislative and judicial assembly was initiated to regulate the icelandic commonwealth lack of arable land also served impetus to the settlement of greenland starting in 986 22 the period of these early settlements coincided with the medieval warm period when temperatures were similar to those of the early 20th century 23 at this time about 25 of iceland was covered with forest compared to 1 in

located above a mantle plume causing iceland to be subaerial above the surface of the sea the ridge marks the boundary between the eurasian and north american plates and iceland was created by rifting and accretion through volcanism along the ridge 47 many fjords punctuate iceland s 4,970-kilometre 3,088-mile long coastline which is also where most settlements are situated the island s interior the highlands of iceland is a cold and uninhabitable combination of sand mountains and lava fields the major towns are the capital city of reykjavík along with its outlying towns of kópavogur

herðubreið and eldfell 51 the volcanic eruption of laki in 1783–1784 caused a famine that killed nearly a quarter of the island s population 52 in addition the eruption caused dust clouds and haze to appear over most of europe and parts of asia and africa for several months afterward and affected climates in other areas 53 iceland has many geysers including geysir from which the english word is derived and the famous strokkur which erupts every 8–10 minutes after a phase of inactivity geysir started erupting again after a series of earthquakes in 2000 geysir has since grown quieter and does not erupt often 54 with the widespread availability of geothermal power and the harnessing of many rivers and waterfalls for hydroelectricity most residents have access to inexpensive hot water heating and electricity the island is composed primarily of basalt a low silica lava associated with effusive volcanism as has occurred also in hawaii iceland however has a variety of volcanic types composite and fissure many producing more evolved lavas such as rhyolite and andesite iceland has hundreds of volcanoes with approx 30 volcanic systems active 55 surtsey one of the youngest islands in

eruptions on 14 april forced hundreds of people to abandon their homes 58 the resultant cloud of volcanic ash brought major disruption to air travel across europe 59 another large eruption occurred on 21 may 2011 this time it was the grímsvötn volcano located under the thick ice of europe s largest glacier vatnajökull grímsvötn is one of iceland s most active volcanoes and this eruption was much

which came to the island at the end of the ice age walking over the frozen sea on rare occasions bats have been carried to the island with the winds but they are not able to breed there polar bears occasionally come over from greenland but they are just visitors and no icelandic populations exist 65 there are no native or free-living reptiles or amphibians on the island 66 phytogeographically iceland belongs to the arctic province of the circumboreal region within the boreal kingdom approximately three quarters of the island are barren of vegetation plant life consists mainly of grassland which is regularly grazed by livestock the most common tree native to iceland is the northern birch betula pubescens which formerly formed forests over much of iceland along with aspens populus tremula rowans sorbus aucuparia common junipers juniperus communis and other smaller trees mainly willows when the island was first settled it was extensively forested in the late 12th century ari the wise described it in the Íslendingabók as forested from mountain to sea shore 67 permanent human settlement greatly disturbed the isolated ecosystem of thin volcanic soils and limited species diversity the forests were heavily exploited over the centuries for firewood and timber 64 deforestation climatic deterioration during the little ice age and overgrazing by sheep imported by settlers caused a loss of critical topsoil due to erosion today many farms have been abandoned three quarters of iceland s 100,000 square kilometres are affected by soil erosion 18,000 km 2 6,900 sq mi serious enough to make the land useless 67 only a few small birch stands now exist in isolated reserves the planting of new forests has increased the number of trees but the result does not compare to the

in 1983 to advance the political economic and social needs of women after participating in its first parliamentary elections the women s list helped increase the proportion of female parliamentarians by 15 76 although it disbanded in 1999 merging with the social democratic alliance it left a lasting influence on iceland s politics every major party has a 40 quota for women and in 2009 nearly a third of members of parliament were female compared to the global average of 16 77 in 2011 iceland was ranked 2nd in the strength of its democratic institutions 78 and 13th in government transparency

government of iceland the parliament of iceland in reykjavík the cabinet of iceland and the prime minister s office in reykjavík iceland is a representative democracy and a parliamentary republic the modern parliament alþingi english althing was founded in 1845 as an advisory body to the danish monarch it was widely seen as a re-establishment of the assembly founded in 930 in the commonwealth period and suspended in 1799 consequently it is arguably the world s oldest parliamentary democracy 82 it currently has 63 members elected for a maximum period of four years 83 the president is elected by popular vote for a term of four years with no term limit the elections for president the althing and local municipal councils are all held separately every four years 84 the president of iceland is a largely ceremonial head of state and serves as a diplomat but may veto laws voted by the parliament and put them to a national referendum the current president is guðni th jóhannesson the head of government is the prime minister who together with the cabinet is responsible for executive government the cabinet is appointed by the president after a general election to the althing however the appointment is usually negotiated by the leaders of the political parties who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how to distribute its seats under the condition that it has a majority support in the althing only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves within a reasonable time span does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet personally this has not happened since the republic was founded in 1944 but in 1942 regent sveinn björnsson who had been installed in that position by the althing in 1941 appointed a non-parliamentary government the regent had for all practical purposes the position of a president and sveinn would later become the country s first president in 1944 the governments of iceland have always been coalition governments with two or more parties involved as no single political party has ever received a majority of seats in the althing throughout the republican period the extent of the political power possessed by the office of the president is disputed by legal scholars which in iceland several provisions of the constitution appear to give the president some important powers but other provisions and traditions suggest differently citation needed in 1980 icelanders elected vigdís finnbogadóttir as president the world s first directly elected female head of state she
