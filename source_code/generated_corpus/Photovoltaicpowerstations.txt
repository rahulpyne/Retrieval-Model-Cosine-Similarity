photovoltaic power station wikipedia photovoltaic power station from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from photovoltaic power stations jump to navigation search the 25.7 mw lauingen energy park in bavarian swabia germany a photovoltaic power station also known as a solar park is a large-scale photovoltaic system pv system designed for the supply of merchant power into the electricity grid they are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they supply power at the utility level rather than to a local user or users they are sometimes also referred to as solar farms or solar ranches especially when sited in agricultural areas the generic expression utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project the solar power source is via photovoltaic modules that convert light directly to electricity however this differs from and should not be confused with concentrated solar power the other large-scale solar generation technology which uses heat to drive a variety of conventional generator systems both approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages but to date for a variety of reasons photovoltaic technology has seen much wider use in the field as of 2013 update pv systems outnumber concentrators by about 40 to 1 in some countries the nameplate capacity of a photovoltaic power stations is rated in megawatt-peak mw p which refers to the solar array s dc power output however canada japan spain and some parts of the united states often specify using the converted lower nominal power output in mw ac a measure directly comparable to other forms of power generation a third and less common rating is the mega volt-amperes mva most solar parks are developed at a scale of at least 1 mw p as of 2015 the world s largest operating photovoltaic power stations have capacities of close to 600 megawatts and projects up to 1 gigawatt are planned as at the end of 2015 about 3,400 projects with a combined capacity of 60 gw ac were solar farms larger than 4 mw 1 most of the existing large-scale photovoltaic power stations are owned and operated by independent power producers but the involvement of community and utility-owned projects is increasing to date almost all have been supported at least in part by regulatory incentives such as feed-in tariffs or tax credits but as levelized costs have fallen significantly in the last decade and grid parity has been reached in an increasing number of markets it may not be long before external incentives cease to exist history edit the first 1 mw p solar park was built by arco solar at lugo near hesperia california at the end of 1982 2 followed in 1984 by a 5.2 mw p installation in carrizo plain 3 both have since been decommissioned though carrizo plain is the site for several large plants now being constructed 4 or planned the next stage followed the 2004 revisions 5 to the feed-in tariffs in germany 6 when a substantial volume of solar parks were constructed 6 serpa solar park built in portugal in 2006 several hundred installations over 1 mw p have been since been installed in germany of which more than 50 are over 10 mw p 7 with its introduction of feed-in tariffs in 2008 spain became briefly the largest market with some 60 solar parks over 10 mw 8 but these incentives have since been withdrawn 9 the usa 10 china 11 india 12 france 13 canada 14 and italy 15 amongst others have also become major markets as shown on the list of photovoltaic power stations the largest sites under construction have capacities of hundreds of mw p and projects at a scale of 1 gw p are being planned 4 16 17 siting and land use edit the land area required for a desired power output varies depending on the location 18 and on the efficiency of the solar modules 19 the slope of the site 20 and the type of mounting used fixed tilt solar arrays using typical modules of about 15 efficiency 21 on horizontal sites need about 1 hectare mw in the tropics and this figure rises to over 2 hectares in northern europe 18 because of the longer shadow the array casts when tilted at a steeper angle 22 this area is typically about 10 higher for an adjustable tilt array or a single axis tracker and 20 higher for a 2-axis tracker 23 though these figures will vary depending on the latitude and topography 24 the best locations for solar parks in terms of land use are held to be brown field sites or where there is no other valuable land use 25 even in cultivated areas a significant proportion of the site of a solar farm can also be devoted to other productive uses such as crop growing 26 27 or biodiversity 28 agrivoltaics edit agrivoltaics is co-developing the same area of land for both solar photovoltaic power as well as for conventional agriculture a recent study found that the value of solar generated electricity coupled to shade-tolerant crop production created an over 30 increase in economic value from farms deploying agrivoltaic systems instead of conventional agriculture 29 co-location edit in some cases several different solar power stations with separate owners and contractors are developed on adjacent sites 30 this can offer the advantage of the projects sharing the cost and risks of project infrastructure such as grid connections and planning approval 31 solar farms can also be co-located with wind farms 32 sometimes the title solar park is used rather than an individual solar power station 33 34 some examples of such solar clusters are the charanka solar park where there are 17 different generation projects neuhardenberg 35 36 with eleven plants and the golmud solar parks with total reported capacity over 500mw 37 38 an extreme example is calling all of the solar farms in the gujarat state of india a single solar park the gujarat solar park technology edit most solar parks are ground mounted pv systems also known as free-field solar power plants 39 they can either be fixed tilt or use a single axis or dual axis solar tracker 40 while tracking improves the overall performance it also increases the system s installation and maintenance cost 41 42 a solar inverter converts the array s power output from dc to ac and connection to the utility grid is made through a high voltage three phase step up transformer of typically 10 kv and above 43 44 solar array arrangements edit the solar arrays are the subsystems which convert incoming light into electrical energy 45 they comprise a multitude of solar modules mounted on support structures and interconnected to deliver a power output to electronic power conditioning subsystems 46 a minority of utility-scale solar parks are configured on buildings 47 and so use building-mounted solar arrays the majority are free field systems using ground-mounted structures 39 usually of one of the following types fixed arrays edit double glass photovoltaic solar modules installed on a fixed support structure many projects use mounting structures where the solar modules are mounted at a fixed inclination calculated to provide the optimum annual output profile 40 the modules are normally oriented towards the equator at a tilt angle slightly less than the latitude of the site 48 in some cases depending on local climatic topographical or electricity pricing regimes different tilt angles can be used or the arrays might be offset from the normal east-west axis to favour morning or evening output 49 a variant on this design is the use of arrays whose tilt angle can be adjusted twice or four times annually to optimise seasonal output 40 they also require more land area to reduce internal shading at the steeper winter tilt angle 22 because the increased output is typically only a few percent it seldom justifies the increased cost and complexity of this design 23 dual axis trackers edit bellpuig solar park near lerida spain uses pole-mounted 2-axis trackers to maximise the intensity of incoming direct radiation solar panels should be orientated normal to the sun s rays 50 to achieve this arrays can be designed using two-axis trackers capable of tracking the sun in its daily orbit across the sky and as its elevation changes throughout the year 51 these arrays need to be spaced out to reduce inter-shading as the sun moves and the array orientations change so need more land area 52 they also require more complex mechanisms to maintain the array surface at the required angle the increased output can be of the order of 30 53 in locations with high levels of direct radiation but the increase is lower in temperate climates or those with more significant diffuse radiation due to overcast conditions for this reason dual axis trackers are most commonly used in subtropical regions 52 and were first deployed at utility scale at the lugo plant 2 single axis trackers edit a third approach achieves some of the output benefits of tracking with a lesser penalty in terms of land area capital and operating cost this involves tracking the sun in one dimension – in its daily journey across the sky – but not adjusting for the seasons 54 the angle of the axis is normally horizontal though some such as the solar park at nellis airforce base which have a 20° tilt 55 incline the axis towards the equator in a north-south orientation – effectively a hybrid between tracking and fixed tilt 56 single axis tracking systems are aligned along axes roughly north-south 57 some use linkages between rows so that the same actuator can adjust the angle of several rows at once 54 power conversion edit solar panels produce direct current dc electricity so solar parks need conversion equipment 46 to convert this to alternating current ac which is the form transmitted by the electricity grid this conversion is done by inverters to maximise their efficiency solar power plants also incorporate maximum power point trackers either within the inverters or as separate units these devices keep each solar array string close to its peak power point 58 there are two primary alternatives for configuring this conversion equipment centralised and string inverters 59 although in some cases individual or micro-inverters are used 60 single inverters allows optimizing the output of each panel and multiple inverters increases the reliability by limiting the loss of output when an inverter fails 61 centralised inverters edit waldpolenz solar park 62 is divided into blocks each with a centralised inverter these units have relatively high capacity typically of the order of 1 mw 63 so they condition that the output of a substantial block of solar arrays up to perhaps 2 hectares 4.9 acres in area 64 solar parks using centralised inverters are often configured in discrete rectangular blocks with the related inverter in one corner or the centre of the block 65 66 67 string inverters edit string inverters are substantially lower in capacity of the order of 10 kw 63 68 and condition the output of a single array string this is normally a whole or part of a row of solar arrays within the overall plant string inverters can enhance the efficiency of solar parks where different parts of the array are experiencing different levels of insolation for example where arranged at different orientations or closely packed to minimise site area 61 transformers edit the system inverters typically provide power output at voltages of the order of 480 v ac 69 70 electricity grids operate at much higher voltages of the order of tens or hundreds of thousands of volts 71 so transformers are incorporated to deliver the required output to the grid 44 due to the long lead time the long island solar farm chose to keep a spare transformer onsite as transformer failure would have kept the solar farm offline for a long period 72 transformers typically have a life of 25 to 75 years and normally do not require replacement during the life of a photovoltaic power station 73 system performance edit the performance of a solar park is a function of the climatic conditions the equipment used and the system configuration the primary energy input is the global light irradiance in the plane of the solar arrays and this in turn is a combination of the direct and the diffuse radiation 74 a key determinant of the output of the system is the conversion efficiency of the solar modules which will depend in particular on the type of solar cell used 75 there will be losses between the dc output of the solar modules and the ac power delivered to the grid due to a wide range of factors such as light absorption losses mismatch cable voltage drop conversion efficiencies and other parasitic losses 76 a parameter called the performance ratio 77 has been developed to evaluate the total value of these losses the performance ratio gives a measure of the output ac power delivered as a proportion of the total dc power which the solar modules should be able to deliver under the ambient climatic conditions in modern solar parks the performance ratio should typically be in excess of 80 78 79 system degradation edit early photovoltaic systems output decreased as much as 10 year 3 but as of 2010 the median degradation rate was 0.5 year with modules made after 2000 having a significantly lower degradation rate so that a system would lose only 12 of its output performance in 25 years a system using modules which degrade 4 year will lose 64 of its output during the same period 80 many panel makers offer a performance guarantee typically 90 in ten years and 80 over 25 years the output of all panels is typically warranteed at plus or minus 3 during the first year of operation 81 the business of developing solar parks edit westmill solar park 82 is the world s largest community-owned solar power station 83 solar power plants are developed to deliver merchant electricity into the grid as an alternative to other renewable fossil or nuclear generating stations 84 the plant owner is an electricity generator most solar power plants today are owned by independent power producers ipp s 85 though some are held by investor or community-owned utilities 86 some of these power producers develop their own portfolio of power plants 87 but most solar parks are initially designed and constructed by specialist project developers 88 typically the developer will plan the project obtain planning and connection consents and arrange financing for the capital required 89 the actual construction work is normally contracted to one or more epc engineering procurement and construction contractors 90 major milestones in the development of a new photovoltaic power plant are planning consent 91 grid connection approval 92 financial close 93 construction 94 connection and commissioning 95 at each stage in the process the developer will be able to update estimates of the anticipated performance and costs of the plant and the financial returns it should be able to deliver 96 planning approval edit photovoltaic power stations occupy at least one hectare for each megawatt of rated output 97 so require a substantial land area which is subject to planning approval the chances of obtaining consent and the related time cost and conditions varying from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and location to location many planning approvals will also apply conditions on the treatment of the site after the station has been decommissioned in the future 70 a professional health safety and environment assessment is usually undertaken during the design of a pv power station in order to ensure the facility is designed and planned in accordance with all hse regulations grid connection edit the availability locality and capacity of the connection to the grid is a major consideration in planning a new solar park and can be a significant contributor to the cost 98 most stations are sited within a few kilometres of a suitable grid connection point this network needs to be capable of absorbing the output of the solar park when operating at its maximum capacity the project developer will normally have to absorb the cost of providing power lines to this point and making the connection in addition often to any costs associated with upgrading the grid so it can accommodate the output from the plant 99 operation and maintenance edit once the solar park has been commissioned the owner usually enters into a contract with a suitable counterparty to undertake operation and maintenance o m 100 in many cases this may be fulfilled by the original epc contractor 101 solar plants reliable solid-state systems require minimal maintenance compared to rotating machinery for example 102 a major aspect of the o m contract will be continuous monitoring of the performance of the plant and all of its primary subsystems 103 which is normally undertaken remotely 104 this enables performance to be compared with the anticipated output under the climatic conditions actually experienced 93 it also provides data to enable the scheduling of both rectification and preventive maintenance 105 a small number of large solar farms use a separate inverter 106 107 or maximizer 108 for each solar panel which provide individual performance data that can be monitored for other solar farms thermal imaging is a tool that is used to identify non-performing panels for replacement 109 power delivery edit a solar park s income derives from the sales of electricity to the grid and so its output is metered in real-time with readings of its energy output provided typically on a half-hourly basis for balancing and settlement within the electricity market 110 income is affected by the reliability of equipment within the plant and also by the availability of the grid network to which it is exporting 111 some connection contracts allow the transmission system operator to constrain the output of a solar park for example at times of low demand or high availability of other generators 112 some countries make statutory provision for priority access to the grid 113 for renewable generators such as that under the european renewable energy directive 114 economics and finance edit in recent years pv technology has improved its electricity generating efficiency reduced the installation cost per watt as well as its energy payback time epbt and has reached grid parity in at least 19 different markets by 2014 115 116 photovoltaics is increasingly becoming a viable source of mainstream power 117 however prices for pv systems show strong regional variations much more than solar cells and panels which tend to be global commodities in 2013 utility-scale system prices in highly penetrated markets such as china and germany were significantly lower 1.40 w than in the united states 3.30 w the iea explains these discrepancies due to differences in soft costs which include customer acquisition permitting inspection and interconnection installation labor and financing costs 118 14 utility-scale pv system prices country cost w australia 2.0 china 1.4 france 2.2 germany 1.4 italy 1.5 japan 2.9 united kingdom 1.9 united states 3.3 for utility-scale pv systems in 2013 118 15 grid parity edit main article grid parity solar generating stations have become progressively cheaper in recent years and this trend is expected to continue 119 meanwhile traditional electricity generation is becoming progressively more expensive 120 these trends are expected to lead to a crossover point when the levelised cost of energy from solar parks historically more expensive matches the cost of traditional electricity generation 121 this point is commonly referred to as grid parity 122 for merchant solar power stations where the electricity is being sold into the electricity transmission network the levelised cost of solar energy will need to match the wholesale electricity price this point is sometimes called wholesale grid parity or busbar parity 123 some photovoltaic systems such as rooftop installations can supply power directly to an electricity user in these cases the installation can be competitive when the output cost matches the price at which the user pays for his electricity consumption this situation is sometimes called retail grid parity socket parity or dynamic grid parity 124 research carried out by un-energy in 2012 suggests areas of sunny countries with high electricity prices such as italy spain and australia and areas using diesel generators have reached retail grid parity 123 incentive mechanisms edit because the point of grid parity has not yet been reached in many parts of the world solar generating stations need some form of financial incentive to compete for the supply of electricity 125 many legislatures around the world have introduced such incentives to support the deployment of solar power stations 126 feed-in tariffs edit main article feed-in tariff feed in tariffs are designated prices which must be paid by utility companies for each kilowatt hour of renewable electricity produced by qualifying generators and fed into the grid 127 these tariffs normally represent a premium on wholesale electricity prices and offer a guaranteed revenue stream to help the power producer finance the project 128 renewable portfolio standards and supplier obligations edit main article renewable portfolio standard these standards are obligations on utility companies to source a proportion of their electricity from renewable generators 129 in most cases they do not prescribe which technology should be used and the utility is free to select the most appropriate renewable sources 130 there are some exceptions where solar technologies are allocated a proportion of the rps in what is sometimes referred to as a solar set aside 131 loan guarantees and other capital incentives edit main article loan guarantee some countries and states adopt less targeted financial incentives available for a wide range of infrastructure investment such as the us department of energy loan guarantee scheme 132 which stimulated a number of investments in the solar power plant in 2010 and 2011 133 tax credits and other fiscal incentives edit main article tax credit another form of indirect incentive which has been used to stimulate investment in solar power plant was tax credits available to investors in some cases the credits were linked to the energy produced by the installations such as the production tax credits 134 in other cases the credits were related to the capital investment such as the investment tax credits 135 international national and regional programmes edit in addition to free market commercial incentives some countries and regions have specific programs to support the deployment of solar energy installations the european union s renewables directive 136 sets targets for increasing levels of deployment of renewable energy in all member states each has been required to develop a national renewable energy action plan showing how these targets would be met and many of these have specific support measures for solar energy deployment 137 the directive also allows states to develop projects outside their national boundaries and this may lead to bilateral programs such as the helios project 138 the clean development mechanism 139 of the unfccc is an international programme under which solar generating stations in certain qualifying countries can be supported 140 additionally many other countries have specific solar energy development programmes some examples are india s jnnsm 141 the flagship program in australia 142 and similar projects in south africa 143 and israel 144 financial performance edit the financial performance of the solar power plant is a function of its income and its costs 23 the electrical output of a solar park will be related to the solar radiation the capacity of the plant and its performance ratio 77 the income derived from this electrical output will come primarily from the sale of the electricity 145 and any incentive payments such as those under feed-in tariffs or other support mechanisms 146 electricity prices may vary at different times of day giving a higher price at times of high demand 147 this may influence the design of the plant to increase its output at such times 148 the dominant costs of solar power plants are the capital cost and therefore any associated financing and depreciation 149 though operating costs are typically relatively low especially as no fuel is required 102 most operators will want to ensure that adequate operation and maintenance cover 103 is available to maximise the availability of the plant and thereby optimise the income to cost ratio 150 geography edit main articles solar power by country and growth of photovoltaics the first places to reach grid parity were those with high traditional electricity prices and high levels of solar radiation 18 currently more capacity is being installed in the rooftop than in the utility-scale segment however the worldwide distribution of solar parks is expected to change as different regions achieve grid parity 151 this transition also includes a shift from rooftop towards utility-scale plants since the focus of new pv deployment has changed from europe towards the sunbelt markets where ground-mounted pv systems are favored 152 43 because of the economic background large-scale systems are presently distributed where the support regimes have been the most consistent or the most advantageous 153 total capacity of worldwide pv plants above 4 mw ac was assessed by wiki-solar as 36 gw in c 2,300 installations at the end of 2014 154 and represents about 25 percent of total global pv capacity of 139 gw 152 17 the countries which had the most capacity in descending order were the united states china germany india united kingdom spain italy canada and south africa 155 activities in the key markets are reviewed individually below china edit main article solar power in china china was reported in early 2013 to have overtaken germany as the nation with the most utility-scale solar capacity 156 much of this has been supported by the clean development mechanism 157 the distribution of power plants around the country is quite broad with the highest concentration in the gobi desert 11 and connected to the northwest china power grid 158 germany edit main article solar power in germany the first multi-megawatt plant in europe was the 4.2 mw community-owned project at hemau commissioned in 2003 159 but it was the revisions to the german feed-in tariffs in 2004 5 which gave the strongest impetus to the establishment of utility-scale solar power plants 160 the first to be completed under this programme was the leipziger land solar park developed by geosol 161 several dozen plants were built between 2004 and 2011 several of which were at the time the largest in the world the eeg the law which establishes germany’s feed-in tariffs provides the legislative basis not just for the compensation levels but other regulatory factors such as priority access to the grid 113 the law was amended in 2010 to restrict the use of agricultural land 162 since which time most solar parks have been built on so-called ‘development land’ such as former military sites 35 partly for this reason the geographic distribution of photovoltaic power plants in germany 7 is biased towards the former eastern germany 163 164 as of february 2012 germany had 1.1 million photovoltaic power plants most are small kw roof mounted 165 india edit main article solar power in india india has been rising up the leading nations for the installation of utility-scale solar capacity 156 the charanka solar park in gujarat was opened officially in april 2012 166 and was at the time the largest group of solar power plants in the world geographically the majority of the stations are located in gujarat and maharashtra 12 rajasthan has successfully been attempting to attract solar development 167 it and gujarat share the thar desert along with pakistan italy edit main article solar power in italy italy has a very large number of photovoltaic power plants the largest of which is the 84 mw montalto di castro project 168 spain edit main article solar power in spain the majority of the deployment of solar power stations in spain to date occurred during the boom market of 2007-8 169 the stations are well distributed around the country with some concentration in extremadura castile-la mancha and murcia 8 united kingdom edit main article solar power in the united kingdom the introduction of feed-in tariffs in the united kingdom in 2010 stimulated the first wave of utility-scale projects 170 with c 20 plants being completed 171 before tariffs were reduced on 1 august 2011 following the fast track review 172 a second wave of installations was undertaken under the uk s renewables obligation with the total number of plants connected by the end of march 2013 reaching 86 173 this is reported to have made the uk europe s best market in the first quarter of 2013 174 uk projects were originally concentrated in the south west but have more recently spread across the south of england and into east anglia and the midlands 175 the first solar park in wales came on stream in 2011 at rhosygilwen north pembrokeshire 176 as of june 2014 there were 18 schemes generating more than 5 mw and 34 in planning or construction in wales 177 united states edit main article solar power in the united states the us deployment of photovoltaic power stations is largely concentrated in southwestern states 10 the renewable portfolio standards in california 178 and surrounding states 179 180 provide a particular incentive the volume of projects under construction in early 2013 has led to the forecast that the us will become the leading market 156 noteworthy solar parks edit main article
