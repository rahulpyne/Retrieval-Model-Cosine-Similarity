genetic resources it links traditional conservation efforts to the economic goal of using biological resources sustainably it sets principles for the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources notably those destined for commercial use it also covers the rapidly expanding field of biotechnology through its cartagena protocol on biosafety addressing technology development and transfer benefit-sharing and biosafety issues importantly the convention is legally binding countries that join it parties are obliged to implement its provisions the convention reminds decision-makers that natural resources are not infinite and sets out a philosophy of sustainable use while past conservation efforts were aimed at protecting particular species and habitats the convention recognizes that ecosystems species and genes must be used for the benefit of humans however this should be done in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity the convention also offers decision-makers guidance based on the precautionary principle that where there is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a threat the convention acknowledges that substantial investments are required to conserve biological diversity it argues however that conservation will bring us significant environmental economic and social benefits in return the convention on biological diversity of 2010 would ban some forms of geoengineering issues edit some of the many issues dealt with under the convention include measures the incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biological

to balance public health against economic benefits it will for example let countries ban imports of a genetically modified organism if they feel there is not enough scientific evidence the product is safe and requires exporters to label shipments containing genetically modified commodities such as corn or cotton the required number of 50 instruments of ratification accession approval acceptance by
